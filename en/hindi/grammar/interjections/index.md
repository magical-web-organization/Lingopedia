These are words or sounds that express strong feelings or emotions and often convey a speaker's speech or thought process. In Hindi, interjections are called "Sanskriti Shabd," which means cultural words, and they play a vital role in daily conversations.

## Importance of Interjections in Hindi

Interjections add flavor and color to a conversation, making it more engaging and effective. They help in expressing emotions, creating emphasis, and breaking monotony.
