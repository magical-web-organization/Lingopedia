# Hindi Definite Articles

In Hindi language, definite articles are used to specify a particular noun or to refer to something that has already been mentioned. In English language, the words "the" or "that" usually act as definite articles, and these also exist in Hindi.

## Hindi Definite Articles

Below given are the Hindi definite articles and their English translations.

| Hindi | English |
| --- | --- |
| यह (yah) | This |
| वह (vah) | That |
| उस (us) | That (over there) |
| इन (in) | These |
| उन (un) | Those |

## Use of Hindi Definite Articles

1. To specify a particular noun: 

The definite article "vah" is used to specify a particular noun, just like "the" in English. For example, "vah ghar" means "that house".

2. To refer to something already mentioned: 

If something has already been mentioned before, then the definite article "yah" is used to refer to it. For example, "mere mobile ke saath kya hua? Yah kho gaya" means "What happened to my mobile? It got lost".

3. To indicate proximity: 

In Hindi language, definite articles can also be used to indicate proximity. "Yah" is used to indicate something that is close by, while "vah" is used for something that is farther away. For example, "yah kitaab" means "this book" and "vah kitaab" means "that book".

4. To indicate a group of objects: 

When talking about a group of objects, the definite article "un" is used. For example, "un kitabo" means "those books".

5. To show possession: 

The definite article "us" is used to show possession. For example, "uske kapde" means "his clothes".

## Exceptions

There are some nouns in Hindi language that do not require the use of definite articles. For example, names of people, places or animals do not require any definite article.

## Conclusion

Hindi definite articles play an important role in the language to indicate and specify a particular noun or to refer to something already mentioned. It is important to use the correct definite article to convey a message clearly and effectively.
