Pronouns are an essential part of any language, as they allow speakers to refer to themselves and others without constantly repeating proper nouns. However, in many languages, pronouns must agree with the gender and number of the noun being referred to. Hindi is no exception; in this article, we'll explore how gender and number agreement works in Hindi pronouns and some common examples.

## Gender Agreement

In Hindi, there are two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Most nouns are either one or the other, although there are some that are gender-neutral. When using pronouns to refer to these nouns, the pronouns must agree with their gender. Here are some examples:

- मैं उसको देखता हूँ (maim usko dekhata hun) - I see him
- मैं उसे देखता हूँ (maim use dekhata hun) - I see her

In the first sentence, the pronoun "him" (उसको) is used because the noun being referred to is masculine. In the second sentence, the pronoun "her" (उसे) is used because the noun being referred to is feminine. Note that the verb ending also changes to agree with the gender of the noun.

## Number Agreement

In addition to gender agreement, Hindi pronouns must also agree with the number of the noun being referred to. Hindi distinguishes between singular and plural nouns, and so do its pronouns. Here are some examples:

- मैं उसे देखता हूँ (maim use dekhata hun) - I see her
- मैं उन्हें देखता हूँ (maim unhen dekhata hun) - I see them

In the first sentence, the pronoun "her" (उसे) is singular because the noun being referred to is singular. In the second sentence, the pronoun "them" (उन्हें) is plural because the noun being referred to is plural. Again, note that the verb ending changes to agree with the number of the noun.

## Conclusion

Hindi pronouns provide a clear example of how gender and number agreement work in a language. To use Hindi pronouns accurately, you must remember to match the gender and number of the noun being referred to. With practice, using Hindi pronouns will become second nature.
