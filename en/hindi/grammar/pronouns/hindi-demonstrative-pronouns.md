# Hindi Demonstrative Pronouns

In Hindi, demonstrative pronouns are used to point out a specific noun or group of nouns. They are often used when referring to objects, people or places that are nearby or far away.

There are four basic demonstrative pronouns in Hindi: **yeh**, **voh**, **ye** and **vo**. These pronouns have different forms depending on the gender and number of the noun they refer to.

## Yeh and Voh

**Yeh** and **voh** are used to refer to specific nouns that are nearby. **Yeh** is used for singular masculine nouns and **voh** for singular feminine nouns.

Examples:
- **Yeh** kitab hai. (This is a book.)
- **Voh** ghar hai. (That is a house.)

For plural nouns, **yeh** and **voh** change to **ye** and **vo** respectively.

Examples:
- **Ye** kitabein hain. (These are books.)
- **Vo** ghar hain. (Those are houses.)

## Ye and Vo
