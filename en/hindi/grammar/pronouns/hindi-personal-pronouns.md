# Hindi Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are words that are used in place of nouns to refer to people or things. In Hindi language, personal pronouns are divided into several categories including gender, number, and formality. In this article, we will take a closer look at Hindi personal pronouns and their usage in different contexts.

## Personal Pronouns in Hindi

As mentioned earlier, Hindi personal pronouns are divided into several categories including gender, number, and formality. Here are the personal pronouns used in Hindi language:

##### Singular Pronouns

- मैं (Main) - I/me
- तू (Tu) - You (informal)
- आप (Aap) - You (formal)
- वह (Vah) - He/him/she/her/it

##### Plural Pronouns

- हम (Ham) - We/us
- तुम (Tum) - You (informal)
- आप (Aap) - You (plural/formal)
- वे (Ve) - They/them

## Usage of Hindi Personal Pronouns

#### Gender

Hindi personal pronouns for the third person are gender-neutral. The word "वह" (Vah) is used to refer to a person regardless of their gender. In order to specify gender, Hindi language has specific gendered nouns that are used along with the pronoun.

For example, if we want to refer to a man, we may use the noun "लड़का" (Ladka) which means boy or young man. The sentence would then be structured like this: "वह लड़का है।" (Vah Ladka hai.) which means "He is a boy/young man."

If we want to refer to a woman, we may use the noun "लड़की" (Ladki) which means girl or young woman. The sentence would then be structured like this: "वह लड़की है।" (Vah Ladki hai.) which means "She is a girl/young woman."

#### Formality

Hindi language also has a form of pronouns that are used to show respect or formality. The pronoun "आप" (Aap) is used to address someone in a formal or respectful way regardless of whether you are addressing one person or a group of people.

For example, if we are addressing an elderly person, we would use the pronoun "आप" (Aap) out of respect. The sentence would then be structured like this: "आप कैसे हो?" (Aap kaise ho?) which means "How are you?"

On the other hand, when we are addressing someone informally or casually, we would use the pronoun "तू" (Tu) if we are addressing one person or "तुम" (Tum) if we are addressing a group of people informally.

#### Number

When referring to multiple people or things in Hindi, plural pronouns are used. The pronoun "हम" (Ham) is used to refer to "we" in Hindi. For example, "हम दोस्त हैं।" (Ham dost hain.) means "We are friends."

The pronoun "तुम" (Tum) can also be used to refer to multiple people informally. For example, "तुम लोग बुरे हो।" (Tum log bure ho.) means "You guys are bad."

The pronoun "आप" (Aap) is used to refer to multiple people in a formal or respectful setting. For example, "आप लोग कैसे हैं?" (Aap log kaise hain?) means "How are you all?"

The pronoun "वे" (Ve) is used to refer to a group of people/things or to refer to something in the third person plural. For example, "वे अच्छे दोस्त हैं।" (Ve acche dost hain.) means "They are good friends."

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Hindi personal pronouns are an essential aspect of the language and are used in everyday conversations in a variety of contexts. The personal pronouns in Hindi have different forms to indicate gender, number, and formality. Understanding the usage of these pronouns is an important step towards mastering the Hindi language.
