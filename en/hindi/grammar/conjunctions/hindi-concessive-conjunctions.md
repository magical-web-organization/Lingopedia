In Hindi language, concessive conjunctions play a crucial role in sentence construction. These conjunctions express a contrast or contradiction between two clauses or ideas in a sentence. They create a sense of concession by showing that one clause contradicts the other. 

Some of the commonly used Hindi concessive conjunctions are:

- भले ही (Bhale Hi)
- तब भी (Tab Bhi)
- भले चाहे (Bhale Chahe)
- मगर (Magar)
- फिर भी (Phir Bhi)
- हालांकि (Halanki)
- परन्तु (Parantu)
- उसके बावजूद (Uske Bavajud)

Bhale Hi is used to show that despite one thing being true, another is still possible. For example, "भले ही तुम्हारा तजुरबा कम हो, तुम मजबूत प्रतिभा रखते हो" (Bhale Hi tumhara tajurba kam ho, tum majboot pratibha rakhte ho) meaning "Although your experience may be less, you still have a strong skill".

Tab Bhi is used to express something that happened even though it seemed that it could not happen. For example, "तब भी मैंने उससे संपर्क किया था" (Tab Bhi maine use se sampark kiya tha) meaning "Even then, I had contacted him".

Bhale Chahe is used to show that something is desired, but it’s not necessary in the situation. For example, "भले चाहे वह जानता हो कि हमारा घर कूछ अलग है" (Bhale Chahe woh jaanata ho ki hamara ghar kuchh alag hai) meaning "Even if he knows our house is different".

Magar is used to show that two clauses are in contradiction to each other. For example, "तुम बहुत अच्छी हो मगर तुम्हारी नैतिकता नहीं है" (Tum bahut achhi ho magar tumhari naitikta nahi hai) meaning "You are very good, but your ethics are not".

Phir Bhi is used to show that despite a previous condition or happening, something else happened. For example, "तुमने मुझे बहुत गुस्से से कहा, फिर भी मैं तुम्हारे पास हूँ" (Tumne mujhe bahut gusse se kaha, phir bhi main tumhare paas hoon) meaning "You said something to me in anger, but still I am with you".

Halanki is used to express that although something happened, it doesn't matter, and it will not have any effect. For example, "हालांकि बारिश हो रही थी, उसने खेलना शुरू कर दिया" (Halanki barish ho rahi thi, usne khelna shuru kar diya) meaning "Although it was raining, he started playing".

Parantu is used to show a contradiction or contrast between two things. For eg. "तुमने अपना सबकुछ दिया है, परन्तु अभी भी इसमें कुछ सच्चाई हो सकती है" (Tumne apna sabkuch diya hai, parantu abhi bhi isme kuchh sachaai ho sakti hai) meaning "You have given everything, but still there can be some truth in it".

Uske Bavajud is used to show a contrast between two things. It means "despite" or "in spite of". For example, "उसके बावजूद वह काम करता है" (Uske bavajud wah kaam karta hai) meaning "Despite it, he works".

In conclusion, concessive conjunctions play a vital role in the Hindi language, and they add an entirely new meaning to a sentence. A knowledge of these conjunctions is essential for anyone who wants to speak and write Hindi fluently. By using these conjunctions in sentences, one can express complex thoughts and ideas in a concise yet meaningful way.
