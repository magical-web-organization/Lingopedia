When it comes to languages, adjectives play a very important role. They allow us to express our thoughts and emotions more accurately and precisely. Adjectives in Hindi language have a great significance as well. In this article, we will discuss the masculine plural form of Hindi adjectives.

In Hindi language, an adjective changes its form to agree with the gender of the noun it modifies. For example, if a noun is masculine, the adjective will also be masculine. Similarly, if the noun is feminine, the adjective will be feminine as well. However, if the noun is plural, the adjective also needs to be in its plural form, regardless of its gender.

To form the masculine plural form of Hindi adjectives, the suffix -एं (-en) is added to the singular form of the adjective. For example:

- काला (kala – black) becomes कालें (kale – black)
- गर्म (garm – hot) becomes गर्में (garmen – hot)
- भारी (bhari – heavy) becomes भारिएं (bharien – heavy)

Notice that the vowel at the end of the adjective changes from -ा (-aa) to -ी (-ii) followed by -एं (-en) to form the plural.

It is important to note that in Hindi, the adjectives come after the noun they modify, unlike in English where they come before the noun. For example, the phrase "Black cats" in Hindi would be "काली बिल्लीयाँ" (kaali billiyan) where काली (kaali) means black, and बिल्लीयाँ (billiyan) is the plural form of बिल्ली (billi), meaning cat.

In conclusion, the masculine plural form of Hindi adjectives is formed by adding the suffix -एं (-en) to the singular form of the adjective. It is important to remember that the adjective must agree with the gender and number of the noun it modifies. Learning the proper use of adjectives in Hindi will greatly enhance your ability to communicate effectively in the language.
