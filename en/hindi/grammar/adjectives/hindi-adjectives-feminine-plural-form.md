Adjectives are an essential part of any language, and Hindi is no exception. In Hindi, adjectives change their form based on the gender and number of the noun that they describe. In this article, we will focus on the feminine plural form of Hindi adjectives.

Formation of Feminine Plural Adjectives:

To form a feminine plural adjective in Hindi, we need to add -ई (-ee) at the end of the masculine singular adjective. For example, let's take the adjective सुंदर (sundar), which means beautiful, and use it with a feminine noun in the plural form:

- सुंदर लड़कियाँ (sundar ladkiyaan) - beautiful girls

As you can see, we added -ई at the end of the adjective सुंदर to make it agree with the feminine plural noun लड़कियाँ (ladkiyaan).

Examples of Feminine Plural Adjectives:

Here are a few more examples of feminine plural adjectives in Hindi:

- लम्बी लड़कियाँ (lambi ladkiyaan) - tall girls
- पतली लड़कियाँ (patli ladkiyaan) - thin girls
- सफ़ेद गायें (safed gaayen) - white cows
- भूरे घोड़े (bhure ghode) - brown horses
- खुश लोग (khush log) - happy people

In all these examples, we added -ई at the end of the masculine singular adjective to make it agree with the feminine plural noun.

Exceptions:

There are a few exceptions to the above rule. For example, if the masculine singular adjective ends in -ए (e), we need to add -एं (en) at the end to form the feminine plural adjective. For example:

- खुश कर्मचारी (khush karmachari) - happy employee
- खुश कर्मचारियाँ (khush karmachariyaan) - happy employees

As you can see, we added -एं at the end of the adjective खुश to form its feminine plural form.

Another exception is when the masculine singular adjective ends in -आ (aa), we need to add -ई (ee) at the end to form its feminine plural. For example:

- भोजपुरी गाने (bhojpuri gaane) - Bhojpuri songs
- भोजपुरी गानियाँ (bhojpuri gaaniyaan) - Bhojpuri songs

As you can see, we added -ई at the end of the adjective भोजपुरी to make it agree with the feminine plural noun गानियाँ (gaaniyaan).

Conclusion:

In Hindi, adjectives change their form based on the gender and number of the noun they describe. Feminine plural adjectives are formed by adding -ई at the end of the masculine singular adjective. However, there are exceptions to this rule, which we need to keep in mind while using Hindi adjectives in feminine plural form.
