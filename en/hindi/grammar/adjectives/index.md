# Hindi Adjectives

Hindi adjectives, known as "visheshan" in Hindi, are words that describe or modify nouns in a sentence. They are used to provide information about the size, color, shape, quality, quantity, and so on of a person, place, thing or an idea. In Hindi grammar, adjectives are usually placed after the noun they modify.

## Forms of Hindi Adjectives

In Hindi, adjectives change their form according to the gender and number of the noun they modify. The following are some of the forms of Hindi adjectives:

- सुंदर लड़का (Sundar Ladka) - Handsome boy
- मोटा आदमी (Mota Aadmi) - Fat man
- झंझटी बात (Jhanjhati Baat) - Useless talk

### Feminine Singular Form

When a Hindi adjective is used to modify a feminine singular noun, it typically ends with "i". For example:

- सुंदर लड़की (Sundar Ladki) - Beautiful girl

- झंझटी लड़की (Jhanjhati Ladki) - Useless girl

## Usage of Hindi Adjectives

Hindi adjectives can be used in a sentence either before or after the noun they modify, but they usually come after. For example:

- यह उससे मोटी औरत है। (Yah usse moti aurat hai) - She is a fatter woman than him.
- उसने झंझटी बातें की। (Usne jhanjhati baten ki) - He spoke useless things.

Hindi adjectives can also be used with adverbs to provide more information about the quality of a noun. For example:

- वह बहुत सुंदर लड़की है। (Vah bahut sundar ladki hai) - She is a very beautiful girl.
- यह काफ़ी मोटा आदमी है। (Yah kafi mota aadmi hai) - He is a quite fat man.
- उसने बड़ी झंझटी बातें की। (Usne badi jhanjhati baten ki) - He spoke really useless things.


In conclusion, Hindi adjectives are an essential part of Hindi grammar that provide additional information about a noun. They can change their form according to the gender and number of the noun they modify, and are generally placed after the noun they modify. Learning Hindi adjectives can help in making meaningful and grammatically correct sentences in Hindi.
