In Hindi, adjectives are essential components of a sentence, as they describe the attributes of a noun or object. Like other languages, Hindi adjectives have different forms depending on the gender and number of nouns. In this article, we will discuss Hindi adjectives in the neuter plural form.

## Formation of Neuter Plural Adjectives

In Hindi, the neuter gender is used for objects that don't have any gender or attributes. Neuter plural adjectives are formed by adding '-e' at the end of the singular neuter adjective. For example:

| Singular Neuter Adjective | Neuter Plural Adjective |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| सुंदर (sundar) | सुंदरे (sundare) |
| बड़ा (bada) | बड़े (bade) |
| खुश (khush) | खुशे (khushe) |

These examples show that the '-e' ending is added to the end of the adjective to form the neuter plural adjective. 

## Usage of Neuter Plural Adjectives

Like other adjective forms in Hindi, neuter plural adjectives are used to describe nouns or objects. They follow the same rule as neuter singular adjectives in that they are placed after the noun they describe. Here are some examples:

- उन लोगों के आँखों में सुंदरे रंग थे। (un logon ke ankhon mein sundare rang the) - "There were beautiful colors in their eyes."
- मेरे पास बड़े और सुंदरे घर हैं। (mere paas bade aur sundare ghar hain) - "I have big and beautiful houses."

In these sentences, the neuter plural adjectives 'sundare' and 'bade' are used to describe the colors and houses respectively.

## Conclusion

Hindi adjectives are important elements of the language used to describe the characteristics of objects and nouns. The neuter plural form of Hindi adjectives is formed by adding '-e' at the end of the neuter singular adjective. Neuter plural adjectives follow the same rules as other adjective forms and are placed after the noun they describe. By adding these adjectives to your vocabulary, you can enhance your Hindi communication skills and express yourself more clearly.
