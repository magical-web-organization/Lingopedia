Language is made up of different components, and one such component is Parts of Speech. A part of speech refers to the grammatical function of words in a sentence. Hindi, like any other language, has nine parts of speech. They are as follow:

### Nouns (संज्ञा)

Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. In Hindi, they are known as संज्ञा. Nouns are divided into five categories:

- व्यक्ति संज्ञा (Person Noun): Names of people, e.g. अमिताभ बच्चन, सोनम कपूर.
- वस्तु संज्ञा (Thing Noun): Names of different things, e.g. सुन्दर फूल, खाने का बर्तन.
- स्थान संज्ञा (Place Noun): Names of different places, e.g. जम्मू, पाकिस्तान.
- भाववाचक संज्ञा (Abstract Noun): Names of feelings, emotions, and ideas, e.g. प्रेम, प्यार.
- विशेषण संज्ञा (Adjective Noun): Names of people, places, and things based on their qualities, e.g. गोरी, स्वस्थ.

### Pronouns (सर्वनाम)

Pronouns are words used in place of nouns, to avoid repetition. In Hindi, pronouns are known as सर्वनाम. 

हम (we), आप (you), वह (he/she), यह (this), उस (that), जो (who), कौन (who), and कितने (how many) are some examples of pronouns in Hindi.

### Adjectives (विशेषण)

Adjectives are words that modify nouns or pronouns. They describe their qualities or characteristics. In Hindi, adjectives are known as विशेषण. 

For example: सुन्दर (beautiful), लम्बा (tall), मोटा (fat) are some examples of adjectives.

### Verbs (क्रिया)

Verbs are words that describe an action, occurrence, or a state of being. In Hindi, verbs are known as क्रिया. 

For example: खाना (to eat), पीना (to drink), जाना (to go) are some examples of verbs.

### Adverbs (क्रिया-विशेषण)

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell us how, when, where, and to what extent someone did something. In Hindi, adverbs are known as क्रिया-विशेषण.

For example: धीरे (slowly), पूरी तरह से (completely), अक्सर (often) are some examples of adverbs.

### Prepositions (सम्बंधबोधक)

Prepositions show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. In Hindi, they are known as सम्बंधबोधक. 

For example: मेज पर (on the table), घर में (in the house), के लिए (for) are some examples of prepositions.

### Conjunctions (समुच्चय बोधक)

Conjunctions are words that connect clauses, sentences or words together. In Hindi, conjunctions are known as समुच्चय बोधक. 

For example: और (and), या (or), लेकिन (but) are some examples of conjunctions.

### Interjections (विस्मयवाचक)

Interjections are words used to express emotions, feelings, and sudden reactions. In Hindi, they are known as विस्मयवाचक. 

For example: वाह! (Wow!), हाय! (Alas!), चूहा! (Oh my goodness!) are some examples of interjections.

### Articles (अर्थवाचक)

Articles are words used to specify or indicate nouns. In Hindi, there are no articles. Hence, there is no distinction between a and an, or the.

In conclusion, understanding the different parts of speech is essential for effective communication in any language. By learning the Hindi parts of speech, you will be able to speak and write Hindi accurately and fluently.
