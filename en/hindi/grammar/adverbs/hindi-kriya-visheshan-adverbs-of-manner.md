In the Hindi language, adverbs of manner are known as Kriya Visheshan. They are used to modify the meaning of a verb, adjective or another adverb by indicating how something is done, or the way in which something happens. 

Kriya Visheshan in Hindi are a crucial part of the language and are used in everyday conversation. They are also particularly useful for writers and poets who want to express themselves in a more imaginative and creative manner.

There are many Kriya Visheshan in Hindi, including some common ones like acchāī se (nicely), khushī se (happily), gaharāī se (deeply), and tejī se (quickly).

Here are some examples of Hindi Kriya Visheshan in use:

- धीमे से चलना - dhīme se chalnā (to walk slowly)
- धीरे से बोलना - dhīre se bolnā (to speak slowly)
- तेज़ी से काम करना - tejī se kām karnā (to work quickly)
- अच्छाई से संगीत बजाना - acchāī se sangīt bajānā (to play music nicely)
- मीठाई से हंसना - mīthāī se haṇsnā (to laugh sweetly)
- तंगी से सोचना - taṅgī se socnā (to think deeply)

To use Kriya Visheshan in a sentence, you simply need to add the adverb after the verb, adjective or another adverb. For example, if you want to say "to walk slowly" in Hindi, you would say "dhīme se chalnā". 

Kriya Visheshan can also be used to add emphasis to a sentence. For example, if you want to say "I am very happy", you would say "main bahut khush hoon". In this sentence, "bahut" is the Kriya Visheshan that adds emphasis to the adjective "khush".

In conclusion, Kriya Visheshan are an essential part of the Hindi language and are widely used in everyday conversation. They add depth and creativity to the language and are an excellent tool for writers and poets. By learning and using Kriya Visheshan, you can take your Hindi language skills to the next level.
