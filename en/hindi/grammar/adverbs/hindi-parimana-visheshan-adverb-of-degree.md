Hindi is a beautiful language that has many fascinating aspects to it, one of which is its use of adverbs of degree. In Hindi, these adverbs are called "Parimana Visheshan". These adverbs are used to describe the degree or intensity of an action or adjective. 

Some common examples of Parimana Visheshan in Hindi include "bahut" (very), "thoda" (a little), "adha" (half), "poora" (completely), and "kuchh" (somewhat). When using these adverbs, it's important to remember to place them directly in front of the word that they are modifying. 

For example, if you wanted to say "I am very happy", you would say "Main bahut khush hoon". In this sentence, "bahut" is the adverb of degree, and it directly modifies the adjective "khush" (happy). 

Another important aspect of using Parimana Visheshan is knowing how to change the degree or intensity of a word. In Hindi, this is done by using different forms of the adverb. 

For example, the adverb "thoda" (a little) can be changed to "bahut thoda" (very little) or "zara sa" (just a little) depending on the desired level of intensity. 

It's also important to note that some Parimana Visheshan have irregular forms. For example, the adverb "kuchh" (somewhat) changes to "kuchh kam" (somewhat less) or "kuchh jyada" (somewhat more) when modifying a quantity. 

In conclusion, Parimana Visheshan, or adverbs of degree, are an important aspect of Hindi language and culture. By learning how to use them correctly, you can greatly improve your Hindi communication skills and express yourself more clearly and effectively.
