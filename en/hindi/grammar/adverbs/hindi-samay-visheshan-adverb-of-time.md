In the Hindi language, adverbs of time are referred to as "Hindi Samay Visheshan." These adverbs are used to indicate the time or duration of an action, event or condition described in a sentence.

Samay Visheshan is a part of speech in the Hindi language, like adjectives or adverbs in English. Adverbs of time are used to modify a verb, indicating when or for how long the action takes place. 

Hindi Samay Visheshan can be broadly classified into two categories: 

- Prepositions (Like "pehle" which means "before" or "baad" which means "after")
- Adverbs (Like "sadaa" which means "always" or "abihi" which means "right now").

Let's take a look at some examples of how Samay Visheshan works in Hindi:

- Mai subah uthkar nashte ke baad jog karta hu (I go for a run after breakfast every morning)
- Mai chaar baje bike se office jata hu (I go to the office by bike at 4 PM)
- Garmi ke mausam mein thand ke paani se nahane se achha lagta hai (In summer, it feels better to take a bath with cold water than to take a shower)

In these examples, the adverbs of time are "subah" (morning), "baad" (after), "chaar baje" (at 4 PM) and "garmi ke mausam mein" (in summer). They help to specify when the action will take place.

One thing to keep in mind when using Hindi Samay Visheshan is that the adverb of time should be placed before the verb it is modifying. For example, in the sentence "Mai chaar baje bike se office jata hu," the adverb of time "chaar baje" comes before the verb "jata hu". This helps to avoid confusion and makes the sentence clearer.

In conclusion, Hindi Samay Visheshan or adverbs of time are important in the Hindi language as they help to specify the time or duration of an action. They can be used as prepositions or adverbs, and should be placed before the verb they modify for clarity. Learning Samay Visheshan can greatly improve one's Hindi language skills, especially when speaking or writing about events or actions in the past, present or future.
