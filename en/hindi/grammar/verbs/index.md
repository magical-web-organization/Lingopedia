# Hindi Verbs: An Introduction

Hindi verbs are an essential part of the language, used to express actions, events, and states of being. They are used in every sentence and play a crucial role in communication. In this article, we will provide an overview of Hindi verbs, including their conjugation, tense, and usage.

## Conjugation of Hindi Verbs

Hindi verbs are conjugated to agree with their subject in person, number, and gender. The verb stem remains the same, and the conjugation is achieved by adding various suffixes. The basic present tense suffix for regular verbs is -ता (-ta) for the singular form and -ते हैं (-te hain) for the plural form. Some verbs, especially irregular ones, have unique conjugations.

Here's an example of the present tense conjugation of the verb "to eat" (खाना - khaana):

| Person/Number | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | मैं खाता हूँ (main khaata hun) | हम खाते हैं (ham khaate hain) |
| 2nd person | तुम खाते हो (tum khaate ho) | आप खाते हैं (aap khaate hain) |
| 3rd person (male) | वह खाता है (vah khaata hai) | वे खाते हैं (ve khaate hain) |
| 3rd person (female) | वह खाती है (vah khaati hai) | वे खाती हैं (ve khaati hain) |

As you can see, the verb "to eat" is conjugated differently depending on the subject's person, number, and gender.

## Tenses of Hindi Verbs

Hindi verbs can be conjugated into various tenses to reflect the time frame of the action. The most common tenses in Hindi are present, past, and future. Besides them, there are other tenses like conditional, subjunctive, imperative, and more.

### Present Tense

As mentioned earlier, the present tense can be expressed by adding -ता (-ta) or -ते हैं (-te hain) to the verb stem.

### Past Tense

The past tense is formed by adding -ा (-aa) or -ी (-ee) to the verb stem. The former is used with masculine subjects, and the latter is used with feminine subjects.

Here's an example of the past tense conjugation of the verb "to eat":

| Person/Number | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | मैं खाया (main khaaya) | हम खाएं (ham khaayein) |
| 2nd person | तुम खाये (tum khaaye) | आप खाएं (aap khaayein) |
| 3rd person (male) | वह खाया (vah khaaya) | वे खाएं (ve khaayein) |
| 3rd person (female) | वह खाई (vah khaai) | वे खाएं (ve khaayein) |

### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding -गा (-gaa) or -गी (-gee) to the verb stem. The former is used with masculine subjects, and the latter is used with feminine subjects.

Here's an example of the future tense conjugation of the verb "to eat":

| Person/Number | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | मैं खाऊंगा (main khaaunga) | हम खाएंगे (ham khaayenge) |
| 2nd person | तुम खाओगे (tum khaaoge) | आप खाएंगे (aap khaayenge) |
| 3rd person (male) | वह खायेगा (vah khaayega) | वे खाएंगे (ve khaayenge) |
| 3rd person (female) | वह खाएगी (vah khaayegi) | वे खाएंगी (ve khaayengi) |

## Usage of Hindi Verbs

Hindi verbs are used in every sentence to convey meaning or represent an idea. They can express a variety of things, such as an action, state of being or accomplishment. Unlike English, Hindi verbs are usually placed at the end of a sentence or clause. This placement is also known as "verb-final" word order.

Here's an example of a verb-final sentence:

तुम्हारी मदद करने के लिए मैं तैयार हूँ। (Tumhaari madad karne ke liye main taiyaar hoon.)

Translation: "I am ready to help you."

In conclusion, Hindi verbs are crucial to understanding and communicating in the language. By understanding their conjugation, tense, and usage, you can take a step further on your journey to becoming fluent in Hindi.
