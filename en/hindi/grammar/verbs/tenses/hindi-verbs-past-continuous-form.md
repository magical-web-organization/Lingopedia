# Hindi Verbs: Past Continuous Form

The past continuous tense in Hindi is used to describe actions or events that were in progress at some time in the past. It is formed by combining the past tense of the auxiliary verb "to be" (था) with the present participle of the main verb (रहा था / रही थी / रहे थे).

## Formation

The formation of the past continuous tense in Hindi is straightforward. The auxiliary verb था (tha) is conjugated into the past tense, and the present participle of the main verb is added to it.

The present participle of the main verb in Hindi is formed by adding रहा था (raha tha), रही थी (rahi thi), or रहे थे (rahe the) to the verb stem. Here are some examples to illustrate the formation:

| Verb | Translation | Present Participles |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| खाना (khaana) | to eat | खा रहा था (khaa raha tha) |
| पढ़ना (padhna) | to read | पढ़ रही थी (padh rahi thi) |
| बोलना (bolna) | to speak | बोल रहे थे (bol rahe the) |

Note that the present participle रहा था (raha tha), रही थी (rahi thi), or रहे थे (rahe the) agrees in gender and number with the subject of the sentence.

## Usage

The past continuous tense in Hindi is used to describe actions or events that were in progress at some time in the past. It is often used to describe background information or to set the scene for a story.

### Examples

| Hindi | Translation |
| ------- | ------------ |
| मैं खा रहा था। | I was eating. |
| मेरी माँ पढ़ रही थी। | My mother was reading. |
| हम सभी बोल रहे थे। | We were all speaking. |

In addition to describing ongoing actions, the past continuous tense can be used to convey a sense of continuity or progression in the past. For example:

| Hindi | Translation |
| ------- | ------------ |
| वह छः महीने से दुकान चला रहा था। | He had been running the shop for six months. |
| हम तीन घंटे से स्टेशन पर खड़े थे। | We had been standing at the station for three hours. |

## Conclusion

It is formed by combining the past tense of the auxiliary verb "to be" with the present participle of the main verb.
