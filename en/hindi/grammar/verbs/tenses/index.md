# Conjugation of Hindi Verbs

Conjugation is an essential aspect of any language as it reflects the grammatical agreement between the subject and the verb in a sentence. In Hindi, verbs play a vital role in sentence formation and convey the action or state of being of the subject. Therefore, it is essential to learn how to conjugate Hindi verbs in different tenses and aspects accurately.

## Forms of Hindi Verbs

Hindi verbs have three principal forms, namely the **present** (vartaman), **past** (bhoot), and **future** (bhavishya) forms. Each form has different tenses and aspects that represent different times, activities and states.

### Present Forms

The present form of Hindi verbs refers to the current state of the action or activity. The present form can be further classified into various tenses, such as the present simple, present continuous and present perfect.

* **Present Simple**: The present simple tense in Hindi describes a habitual action or a general truth happening at the present time. The basic formula for forming the present simple tense is by adding **-taa/-tee** to the verb stem.

```Hindi
Verb: खाना (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खाता/खाती हूँ। (I eat.)
``` 

* **Present Continuous**: The present continuous tense in Hindi describes an action that is currently happening or in progress. The formula for forming the present continuous tense is by adding **-raha/-rahī/-rahe/-rahi** to the verb stem with the appropriate gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खा रहा हूँ (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खा रहा हूँ। (I am eating.)
``` 

* **Present Perfect**: The present perfect tense in Hindi describes a completed action that occurred in the recent past or at an unspecified time before now. The formula for forming the present perfect tense is by combining the verb **होना** (to be) or **जाना** (to go) with the verb stem and adding **-ā/-ī/-e/-īn** to the end of the verb, depending on the gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खा लिया (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खा लिया हूँ। (I have eaten.)
``` 

### Past Forms

The past form of Hindi verbs refers to the completed actions or activities that occurred in the past. The past form can be further classified into various tenses, such as the past simple, past continuous, and past perfect.

* **Past Simple**: The past simple tense in Hindi describes a completed action that took place in the past. The basic formula for forming the past simple tense is by adding **-ā/-ī/-e/-īn** to the verb stem with the appropriate gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खाना (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खाया/खाई/खाए/खाईं। (I ate.)
``` 

* **Past Continuous**: The past continuous tense in Hindi describes an action that was in progress in the past. The formula for forming the past continuous tense is by adding **-rā/-rī/-re/-rīn** to the verb stem with appropriate gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खा रहा था (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खा रहा था। (I was eating.)
``` 

* **Past Perfect**: The past perfect tense in Hindi describes an action that was completed before another action in the past. The formula for forming the past perfect tense is by using the verb **चुकना** (to have done) with the verb stem and adding **-ā/-ī/-e/-īn** to the end of the verb, depending on the gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खा चुका था (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खा चुका था। (I had eaten.)
``` 

### Future Forms

The future form of Hindi verbs refers to an action or activity that will happen in the future. The future form can be further classified into various tenses, such as the simple future, future continuous and future perfect.

* **Simple Future**: The simple future tense in Hindi describes an action that will take place in the future. The basic formula for forming the simple future tense is by adding **-gaa/-gī/-ge/-gīn** to the verb stem with appropriate gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खाना (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खाउंगा/खाउंगी/खाएंगे/खाएंगी। (I will eat.)
``` 

* **Future Continuous**: The future continuous tense in Hindi describes an action that will be in progress at a certain time in the future. The formula for forming the future continuous tense is by using the auxiliary verb **होना** (to be) in the future tense and adding **-rhaa/-rhī/-rhenge/-rhīnghi** with the verb stem, depending on the gender and plurality agreement.

```Hindi
Verb: खा रहा होगा (to eat)
Subject: मैं (I)

मैं खा रहा होगा। (I will be eating.)
``` 

* **Future Perfect**: The future perfect tense in Hindi describes an action that will have been completed before a certain time in the future. The formula for forming the future perfect tense is by using the verb **होना** (to be) or **जाना** (to go) in the future tense with the verb stem and adding **-ā/-ī/-e/-īn** to the end of the verb, depending on the gender and plurality agreement.
