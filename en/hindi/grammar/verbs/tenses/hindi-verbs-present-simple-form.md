Hindi is the fourth most widely spoken language in the world, with over 300 million native speakers. It is the official language of India and is also spoken in Nepal, Mauritius, Fiji, and other countries. If you are learning Hindi, understanding the present simple form of verbs is essential. In this article, we will discuss the suffixes and conjugation rules used in the present simple tense of Hindi verbs.

## Suffixes used in present simple tense

In Hindi, the suffixes used in the present simple tense are -ता/-ती/-ते for masculine singular, feminine singular, and plural respectively. The following table shows the suffixes used with the verb खाना (to eat):

| Pronoun           | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural   |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| I                 | खाता               | खाती                | खाते      |
| You (singular)    | खाता               | खाती                | खाते      |
| He/She/It         | खाता               | खाती                | खाते      |
| We                | खाते               | खाती                | खाते      |
| You (plural)      | खाते               | खाती               | खाते      |
| They (masculine)  | खाते               | खाती               | खाते      |
| They (feminine)   | खाती               | खाती                | खाते      |

As you can see, the suffixes vary depending on the subject of the verb. For masculine singular and plural, the suffix is -ता, for feminine singular it is -ती, and for plural, it is -ते. 

## Conjugation rules

In Hindi, the present tense of regular verbs is formed by adding the suffixes mentioned above to the base form of the verb. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Let's take a look at the conjugation rules:

### Verbs ending in -आ/-ओ

For verbs that end in -आ and -ओ, the final आ/ओ is replaced by ता/ती/ते. For example:

| Verb       | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural   |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| जाना (to go)    | जाता               | जाती                | जाते      |
| आना (to come)    | आता               | आती                | आते      |
| खाना (to eat)  | खाता               | खाती               | खाते      |
| सोना (to sleep)  | सोता               | सोती               | सोते      |

### Verbs ending in -ना

Verbs ending in -ना have an irregular present tense. In this case, the suffixes -ता/-ती/-ते are added after dropping the ना. For example:

| Verb       | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural   |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| जाना (to know)    | जानता               | जानती                | जानते      |
| देखना (to see)  | देखता               | देखती               | देखते      |
| छोड़ना (to leave)  | छोड़ता              | छोड़ती             | छोड़ते     |

### Verbs ending in -ता/-ती/-ते

Verbs that end in -ता/-ती/-ते have the same form in the present tense. For example:

| Verb       | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural   |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| मिलना (to meet)  | मिलता               | मिलती              | मिलते    |
| बोलना (to speak) | बोलता               | बोलती              | बोलते    |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the present simple tense of Hindi verbs involves adding the suffixes -ता/-ती/-ते depending on the subject of the verb. There are some irregular verbs, such as those ending in -ना, which have different conjugation rules. By understanding these suffixes and conjugation rules, you can use Hindi verbs in the present tense with ease.
