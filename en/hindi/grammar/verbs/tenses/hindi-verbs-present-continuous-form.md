Hindi is a widely spoken language in South Asia and is the fourth most spoken language in the world. One of the basic components of Hindi sentences is verbs, which indicates actions, occurrences, or states of being. In Hindi, like in many other languages, verbs have different forms according to the tense they are used in. This article will focus on the present continuous form of Hindi verbs, explaining its formation, uses, and providing examples.

### Formation of Present Continuous Form

The present continuous form of Hindi verbs is known as "vartaman kaal ka ravaiyya" or "वर्तमान काल का रवैय्या" in Hindi. It is formed using the present tense of the auxiliary verb "hona" or "होना" followed by the present participle of the main verb. The present participle of Hindi verbs is formed by dropping the final "na" or "ना" from the infinitive form of the verb and adding "raha" or "रहा" for masculine singular subjects, "rahi" or "रही" for feminine singular subjects, "rahe" or "रहे" for plural subjects, and "rahe hai" or "रहे हैं" for formal or respectful subjects.

| I        | hun            | jaa raha            | main jaa raha hu         |
| You      | ho             | padh rahi           | tum padh rahi ho          |

| They     | hain           | bol rahe           | ve bol rahe hain           |
