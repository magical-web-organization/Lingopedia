## Introduction

Hindi is one of the most widely spoken languages in India and is the fourth most commonly spoken language in the world. Verbs play a crucial role in the Hindi language. A verb is a word that describes an action, occurrence or a state of being. In this article, we will discuss the formation and usage of the future continuous form of Hindi verbs.

## Formation

The future continuous form of a Hindi verb is formed by adding the auxiliary verb 'rahna' (रहना) and the gerund form of the main verb. The gerund form of the verb is created by adding the suffix 'te hue' (ते हुए) to the verb stem.

For example, let's look at the verb 'khelna' (खेलना) which means 'to play'. The future continuous form of this verb would be:

    Main Verb: Khelna (खेलना)
    Gerund Form: Khelte Hue (खेलते हुए)
    Auxiliary Verb: Rahna (रहना)

    Future Continuous Form: Khelte Hue Rahenge (खेलते हुए रहेंगे)
    
Thus, the future continuous form of the verb 'khelna' is 'khelte hue rahenge' which means 'will be playing'.

Similarly, let's look at another example verb 'padhna' (पढना) which means 'to read'. The future continuous form of this verb would be:

    Main Verb: Padhna (पढना)
    Gerund Form: Padhte Hue (पढ़ते हुए)
    Auxiliary Verb: Rahna (रहना)

    Future Continuous Form: Padhte Hue Rahenge (पढ़ते हुए रहेंगे)

Thus, the future continuous form of the verb 'padhna' is 'padhte hue rahenge' which means 'will be reading'.

## Usage

The future continuous tense is used to describe an action that will be in progress at a certain time in the future. It indicates a continued action that will be happening at a specific time in the future. 

For example:
- Mai kal subah saat baje jaane waala hoon. (मैं कल सुबह सात बजे जाने वाला हूँ) - I will be leaving at seven tomorrow morning.
- Woh kal raat 9 baje humein phone karte hue honge. (वे कल रात 9 बजे हमें फोन करते हुए होंगे) - They will be calling us at 9 pm tomorrow night.
- Tum kal subah gym jaate hue dikhai doge. (तुम कल सुबह जिम जाते हुए दिखाई दोगे) - You will be seen going to the gym tomorrow morning.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the future continuous form of a Hindi verb is formed by adding the auxiliary verb 'rahna' and the gerund form of the main verb. It is used to describe an action that will be in progress at a certain time in the future. It is an important tense in the Hindi language and can be used to express future plans and ongoing actions.
