Hindi, one of the official languages of India, is widely spoken and written by millions of people globally. If you are learning Hindi, understanding its verb forms is crucial to communicate effectively.

In Hindi, the future perfect form is used to describe an action that will be completed in the future. It is formed by combining the auxiliary verb "जाना" (jana) with the past participle form of the main verb.

## Formation of Future Perfect Form

The future perfect form in Hindi is formed using the following structure:

`Subject + auxiliary verb "जाना" (jana) in present tense + past participle form of main verb`

Here is how to form the future perfect form using the verb "करना" (karna), which means "to do":

| Person | Auxiliary verb | Verb | Future Perfect Form |

- She has to drink tea, but she won't be able to before Monday.
