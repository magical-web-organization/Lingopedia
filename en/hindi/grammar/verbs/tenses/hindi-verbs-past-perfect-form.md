# Hindi Verbs: Past Perfect Form

Verbs are an essential part of any language as they indicate the action carried out by a subject. When learning Hindi, one of the most crucial areas is to understand the verb system. Hindi verbs change form to reflect tense (past, present, or future), mood (indicative or imperative), gender, and number. 

In this article, we’ll be discussing the past perfect form of Hindi verbs. It’s essential to know how to use this tense to express events or actions that occurred before a specific time in the past.

## What is the Past Perfect Tense? 

The past perfect tense, as the name suggests, is used for work that has already taken place in the past. It is often used to build a narrative that integrates the past and the present. Specifically, it indicates action that had already been completed before another event in the past. 

For example: “I had eaten breakfast before I went to work.”

The past perfect form in Hindi is formed by conjugating the verb होना (hona) in its past participle form followed by the verb’s past participle. 

## How to Form the Past Perfect Tense in Hindi

There are two parts involved in forming the past perfect tense in Hindi: 

1. Conjugating the verb होना (hona) in its past participle form
2. Adding the main verb to the conjugated form of होना (hona)

Here is the conjugation of होना (hona) in past participle form based on the subject:

| Subject  | होना (hona) in Past Participle Form |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| जोड़ी/ I  | हुई thi  |
| तुम / You (singular)  | हुए the  |
| उसने / He/She/It | हुआ tha  |
| हम / We  | हुए the  |
| आप / You  (plural)  | हुए the  |
| वे / They  | हुए the  |

Next, take the past participle form of होना (hona), and add the past participle word of the main verb to it. For example:

| English Sentence  | Hindi Sentence  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| I had eaten | मैं खा चुकी थी  |
| You had gone | तुम चले गए थे  |
| He had slept | उसने सो लिया था  |
| They had talked | वे बातचीत कर चुके थे  |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by learning the past perfect form of Hindi verbs, learners can express events and actions that occured before a certain time in the past. The past perfect form is formed by adding the past participle of the main verb to the conjugated form of होना (hona) in its past participle form. With practice, learners can become proficient in using these verbs in a variety of different contexts.
