In Portuguese, relative pronouns are used in complex sentences to relate two different clauses. This means that they connect two ideas or concepts and indicate how they are related to each other. Understanding these pronouns is an essential part of mastering Portuguese grammar. Here's everything you need to know about Portuguese relative pronouns.

## Usage

In Portuguese, there are three essential relative pronouns: que, quem, and qual. Each of these pronouns has its unique use.

### Que

The most commonly used relative pronoun in Portuguese is que. Its primary function is to connect two clauses with a subject, object, or complement. Here are some examples of the use of "que" in context:

* O carro **que** comprei é muito rápido. (The car **that** I bought is very fast.)
* A roupa **que** você está vestindo é bonita. (The clothing **that** you're wearing is pretty.)
* O livro **que** eu li era interessante. (The book **that** I read was interesting.)

### Quem

The relative pronoun quem is used to refer to a person or people in the subordinate clause. It functions as subject, object or complement. Here are some examples:

* A mulher **quem** vi ontem, estava bonita. (The woman **who** I saw yesterday was pretty.)
* O homem, **quem** eu amo, não está aqui. (The man **who** I love isn't here.)
* O aluno **quem** fui eu, tirou a melhor nota. (The student **who** was me, scored the best grade.)

### Qual

Qual is a more formal and less commonly used relative pronoun. It is used to refer to objects, things, or ideas that represent a person or a group of people. Examples:

* O vinho, **qual** eu bebi, era excelente. (The wine, **which** I drank, was excellent.)
* As pessoas, **qual** eu me referi, foram informadas. (The people, **to whom** I referred, were informed.)
* O curso, **qual** eu me matriculei, é popular. (The course, **which** I enrolled in, is popular.)

## Indicative and Subjunctive Moods

Relative pronouns in Portuguese may take either the indicative or subjunctive moods. Use the indicative mood when it relates to a definite antecedent or definite factual situations. Here are some examples of the use of the indicative mood:

* A casa **que** eu moro é grande. (The house **that** I live in is big.)
* O médico **que** eu consultei é muito bom. (The doctor **that** I consulted is very good.)

On the other hand, use the subjunctive mood when it relates to an indefinite or hypothetical antecedent, to something uncertain or hypothetical, or to a negative statement. Here are some examples:

* Procuro um advogado **quem** entenda de direito penal bem. (I'm looking for a lawyer **who** understands criminal law well.)
* Não há ninguém **quem** não sabe o que aconteceu. (There's no one **who** doesn't know what happened.)

## Conclusion

Relative pronouns are an essential grammar concept in the Portuguese language. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced student, knowing how to use them correctly will improve your communication skills and help you understand Portuguese sentences better. Remember that like all grammar rules, it takes practice to use relative pronouns confidently. Refer to this guide when in doubt and keep practicing. Good luck!
