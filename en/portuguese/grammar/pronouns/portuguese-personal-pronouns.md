## Introduction

Personal pronouns are an essential part of any language, as they allow us to refer to people or things without repeating their names over and over again. In Portuguese, personal pronouns are used frequently in speech and writing. In this article, we will provide an overview of Portuguese personal pronouns, including their usage and conjugation in different tenses and moods.

## Types of Personal Pronouns

In Portuguese, there are two types of personal pronouns: subject pronouns and object pronouns. 

### Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns are used as the subject of a sentence. Portuguese subject pronouns include:

- Eu (I)
- Tu (you, informal)
- Ele (he)
- Ela (she)
- Nós (we)
- Vós (you all, informal)
- Eles (they, masculine)
- Elas (they, feminine)

### Object Pronouns

Object pronouns, on the other hand, are used as the object of a verb, preposition, or infinitive. Portuguese object pronouns include:

- Me (me)
- Te (you, informal)
- Se (himself/herself/itself)
- Nos (us)
- Vos (you all, informal)
- Os (them, masculine)
- As (them, feminine)

## Conjugating Portuguese Pronouns

In Portuguese, personal pronouns change depending on the tense, mood, and voice of the verb they are used with. Here are some examples:

### Present Tense

- Eu falo (I speak) - Tu falas (you speak) - Ele fala (he speaks) - Ela fala (she speaks) - Nós falamos (we speak) - Vós falais (you all speak) - Eles falam (they speak) - Elas falam (they speak)

### Imperfect Tense

- Eu falava (I used to speak) - Tu falavas (you used to speak) - Ele falava (he used to speak) - Ela falava (she used to speak) - Nós falávamos (we used to speak) - Vós faláveis (you all used to speak) - Eles falavam (they used to speak) - Elas falavam (they used to speak)

### Present Subjunctive

- Que eu fale (that I speak) - Que tu fales (that you speak) - Que ele fale (that he speaks) - Que ela fale (that she speaks) - Que nós falemos (that we speak) - Que vós faleis (that you all speak) - Que eles falem (that they speak) - Que elas falem (that they speak)

## Usage

In Portuguese, personal pronouns are often omitted when they are unnecessary. This often occurs when the subject is already understood or when the pronoun is immediately followed by the verb. For example:

- Ela sabe falar (She knows how to speak)
- Vou sair agora (I am going out now)

It is also common to use an object pronoun when the object is already understood. For example:

- Vou comer um bolo. Queres? (I am going to eat a cake. Do you want [it]?)

## Conclusion

Personal pronouns are an integral part of Portuguese grammar. By understanding how to use and conjugate these pronouns, you will be able to communicate more effectively in Portuguese. Remember to pay attention to the context and the sentence structure when using personal pronouns, and you will be well on your way to mastering this essential aspect of the language.
