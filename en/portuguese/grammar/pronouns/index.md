# Portuguese Pronouns

Pronouns are an essential part of any language, including Portuguese. Pronouns are used to replace nouns, and they make sentences more concise and clearer. Portuguese has several types of pronouns, including personal, reflexive, possessive, demonstrative, interrogative, relative, and indefinitive pronouns. 

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are used to replace the subject, direct or indirect object, and possessive nouns. In Portuguese, personal pronouns are separated into two groups: subject and object pronouns.

|Person    |Subject     |Object     |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
|1st singular| Eu (I)    | Me (me)   |
|2nd singular| Tu (you)  | Te (you)  |
|3rd singular| Ele (he)  | O/a (him/her) |
|3rd singular| Ela (she) | O/a (him/her) |
|3rd singular| Você (you)| O/a (him/her) |
|1st plural  | Nós (we)  | Nos (us)  |
|2nd plural  | Vós (you) | Vos (you) |
|3rd plural  | Eles (they)| Os/as (them)|
|3rd plural  | Elas (they)| Os/as (them)|

In formal writing, the pronoun "você" is not used; instead, the third-person singular is employed. 

## Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject of a sentence performs an action on itself. In Portuguese, reflexive pronouns are formed by adding -se to the end of the object pronoun, as shown in the table below.

|Person   |Reflexive       |
|---------|----------------|
|1st singular| Me (myself)  |
|2nd singular| Te (yourself)|
|3rd singular| Se (himself/herself/itself/themselves) |
|1st plural  | Nos (ourselves) |
|2nd plural  | Vos (yourselves) |
|3rd plural  | Se (themselves)   |

## Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns are used to talk about things that belong to someone. In Portuguese, possessive pronouns must agree with the gender and number of the noun they are referring to. Below are the Portuguese possessive pronouns:

|Person   |Masculine    |Feminine   |Plural     |
|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
|1st singular| Meu (my) | Minha (my)| Meus (my) |
|2nd singular| Teu (your)| Tua (your)| Teus (your)|
|3rd singular| Seu (his/her/its/your (formal))| Sua (his/her/its/your (formal))| Seus/Suas (his/her/its/your (formal)) |
|1st plural  | Nosso (our)| Nossa (our)| Nossos (our)|
|2nd plural  | Vosso (your)| Vossa (your)| Vossos (your)|
|3rd plural  | Seu (their/your) | Sua (their/your) | Seus/Suas (their/your) |

## Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used to indicate or point out specific things, people, or ideas. In Portuguese, the three most commonly used demonstrative pronouns are este (this one), esse (that one), and aquele (that one over there). The table below shows the declination of each of them.

|    |Masculine Singular|Feminine Singular| Masculine Plural| Feminine Plural|
|----|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|Esta|Este            |Esta              |Estes           |Estas           |
|Essa|Esse            |Essa              |Esses           |Essas           |
|Aquela|Aquele        |Aquela            |Aqueles         |Aquelas         |

## Interrogative Pronouns

Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions. In Portuguese, there are three core interrogative pronouns: quem (who), que (what), and qual (which). 

## Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns are used to join two sentences by replacing a noun in the second sentence. In Portuguese, the most commonly used relative pronoun is que. Other relative pronouns include o qual (which), a qual (which), os quais (which), and as quais (which).

## Indefinitive Pronouns

Indefinitive pronouns refer to non-specific people or things. In Portuguese, some examples of indefinitive pronouns include alguém (someone), nada (nothing), and muito (many).

## Conclusion

Portuguese pronominal usage follows strict grammatical rules, which may change according to context and meaning. It may sound challenging at the beginning, but as you get comfortable with Portuguese pronouns, using them correctly will become second nature. With enough practice, you can subconsciously recognize the appropriate application of the pronouns in any sentence.
