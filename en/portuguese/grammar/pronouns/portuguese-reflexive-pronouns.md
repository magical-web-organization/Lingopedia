In this article, we will look at the different types of reflexive pronouns in Portuguese and their usage in daily communication.

## What are Reflexive Pronouns in Portuguese?

Reflexive pronouns are pronouns that refer back to the subject of the sentence. In Portuguese, reflexive pronouns are used when the subject of the action and the object of the action are the same person. These pronouns are typically placed before the verb in a sentence, and they change to match the gender and number of the subject.

## Types of Reflexive Pronouns in Portuguese

There are several types of reflexive pronouns in Portuguese, and they vary depending on the person and tense of the verb. Here are some of the most common reflexive pronouns in Portuguese:

- Eu me (myself)
- Tu te (yourself)
- Ele/ela se (himself/herself)
- Nós nos (ourselves)
- Vós vos (yourselves)
- Eles/elas se (themselves)

## Usage of Reflexive Pronouns in Portuguese

Reflexive pronouns are used in a variety of situations in Portuguese. They can be used to talk about personal care routines, physical sensations, and emotional states.

For example, "Eu me lavo" means "I wash myself," and "Ela se sente feliz" means "She feels happy." In both cases, the reflexive pronoun se is used to indicate that the action is being performed by the subject on themselves.

Reflexive pronouns are also commonly used in Portuguese reflexive verbs, such as "Arrepender-se," which means "to regret." In this case, the reflexive pronoun se is used as part of the verb construction.
