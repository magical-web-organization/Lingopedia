When learning Portuguese grammar, one concept that can be a bit tricky is understanding the use of Indefinitive Pronouns. These are words that replace or refer to a noun in a sentence, but without specifying a definite noun. In Portuguese, there are several Indefinitive Pronouns, each with their own specific use. In this article, we’ll go over the different Portuguese Indefinitive Pronouns and how to use them correctly in sentences.

### Algo, Alguma Coisa, Algum

The Indefinite Pronouns “algo”, “alguma coisa”, and “algum” all refer to something that is not identified. The word “algo” is used when referring to a specific object, while “alguma coisa” is more general and can refer to any object. The word “algum” is masculine and is used when referring to a male object, while “alguma” is feminine and is used when referring to a female object.

Examples:

- Algum tem que fazer a tarefa. (Someone has to do the task.)
- Alguma coisa me diz que você está mentindo. (Something tells me you're lying.)
- Algo que você disse me deixou pensativo. (Something you said made me thoughtful.)

### Alguém

The Indefinite Pronoun “alguém” refers to someone who is not identified. It can be used to replace a noun or to refer to a person whose identity is not important.

Examples:

- Alguém me disse que você foi promovido. (Someone told me you were promoted.)

### Ninguém

The Indefinite Pronoun “ninguém” refers to no one or nobody. It is used to replace a noun or to refer to a person whose identity is not important.
