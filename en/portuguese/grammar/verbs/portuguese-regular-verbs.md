Portuguese is a Romance language spoken by about 250 million people, mainly in Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique and other former Portuguese colonies. As with most Romance languages, Portuguese has regular and irregular verbs, which represent different actions, states, feelings or attitudes.

In this article, we will focus on Portuguese regular verbs, which constitute the majority of the verb forms in the language. We will explain their main features, conjugation patterns, tenses and usage, to help you improve your Portuguese skills and communicate effectively with native speakers.

## Features of Portuguese Regular Verbs

Portuguese regular verbs are characterized by the presence of a root, or stem, which remains unchanged throughout the conjugation, and a set of suffixes, which vary according to the mood, tense, person and number of the subject. The root usually ends in a vowel, although there are some exceptions, such as verbs ending in -r or -z.

The suffixes of regular verbs are also predictable, although some of them undergo phonetic or spelling changes to maintain the correct sound or form. For example, the suffix -ar changes to -o, -a, -as, -amos, -ais, -am in the present tense indicative of the first conjugation, while the suffix -er changes to -o, -es, -e, -emos, -eis, -em in the same tense and mood of the second conjugation, and the suffix -ir changes to -o, -es, -e, -imos, -is, -em in the third conjugation.

## Conjugation Patterns of Portuguese Regular Verbs

Portuguese regular verbs are usually classified into three conjugation patterns, based on the ending of their infinitive form: -ar, -er and -ir. These three patterns share some similarities, such as the endings of the past participle and the gerund, which are -ado/-ada/-idos/-idas and -ando/-endo respectively, but differ in some aspects, such as the vowel sound of the root or the stress pattern of certain forms.

Here are the conjugation patterns of some common Portuguese regular verbs, in the present tense indicative:
