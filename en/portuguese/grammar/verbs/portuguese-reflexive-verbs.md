Portuguese is a language that has a great number of reflexive verbs. These verbs are essential in the language and can be found in different verb tenses and modes. In this article, we will explain what reflexive verbs are, how they work in Portuguese, and how to conjugate them.

**What are reflexive verbs?**

Reflexive verbs are verbs that indicate that the subject is performing the action on oneself. For example, in the sentence, "I wash myself," the pronoun "myself" is used to show that the subject is performing the action on oneself. In Portuguese, reflexive verbs are formed by adding "-se" to the end of the verb, for example, "vestir-se" (to dress oneself), "encontrar-se" (to meet oneself).

**How to use reflexive verbs in Portuguese?**

Reflexive verbs are used in Portuguese to express actions that the subject performs on oneself or to indicate the mutual action of two or more people. For example, "Eles se encontraram" (They met each other).

Reflexive verbs are also used in Portuguese to indicate that the subject is doing something for their own benefit or on their own behalf. For example, "Eu me cortei" (I cut myself).

**Conjugating reflexive verbs in Portuguese**

Reflexive verbs in Portuguese are conjugated in the same way as regular verbs, except that the reflexive pronoun is added before the verb. For example, "Eu me levanto" (I get up), "Tu te levantas" (You get up), "Ele/Ela se levanta" (He/She gets up), "Nós nos levantamos" (We get up), "Vós vos levantais" (You all get up), "Eles/Elas se levantam" (They get up).

It is important to note that reflexive verbs are often used in the imperative form in Portuguese. For example, "Levante-se!" (Get up!), "Sentemo-nos" (Let's sit down)

**Conclusion**

Reflexive verbs are an important part of the Portuguese language. They are used to indicate that the subject is performing the action on oneself, doing something for their own benefit or on their own behalf, or indicating the mutual action of two or more people. Conjugating reflexive verbs in Portuguese is not difficult, and with practice, anyone can master the skill of using them correctly.
