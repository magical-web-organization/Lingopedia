# Introduction to Portuguese Verbs

Understanding the basics of Portuguese verbs is essential to speaking the language fluently. The Portuguese language has a wide range of verbs, making it different from its neighboring languages, such as Spanish and French.

## Types of Verbs in Portuguese

There are three types of verbs in the Portuguese language: regular verbs, irregular verbs, and reflexive verbs.

### Regular Verbs

Regular verbs follow a fixed pattern of conjugation, with the verb stem undergoing mofifications in accordance with the tense or mood.

The present tense of Portuguese regular verbs consists of the verb stem with a distinct ending, which depends upon the subject. These endings are as follows:

| Singular | Plural |
|----------|--------|
| eu       | -o     |
| tu       | -s     |
| ele/ela  | -a     |
| nós      | -amos  |
| vós      | -ais   |
| eles/elas| -am    |

For instance, let's take the verb "falar" (to speak) as an example:

| Pronoun | Conjugation |
|---------|-------------|
| eu      | falo        |
| tu      | falas       |
| ele/ela | fala        |
| nós     | falamos     |
| vós     | falais      |
| eles/elas | falam     |

Apart from the present tense, there are numerous tenses and moods in Portuguese that require different conjugations and alterations.

### Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs in Portuguese don't follow the fixed pattern of conjugation of regular verbs. Due to this, you'll need to memorize the most common exceptions.

Some of the most common irregular verbs in Portuguese include "ser" (to be), "estar" (to be), "ter" (to have), and "ir" (to go).

### Reflexive Verbs

In reflexive verbs, the subject of the verb is the same as the object, and the pronoun "se" is added at the end of the infinitive verb.

For instance, let's take the verb "levantar-se" (to get up) as an example:

| Pronoun | Conjugation |
|---------|-------------|
| eu      | levanto-me  |
| tu      | levantas-te |
| ele/ela | levanta-se  |
| nós     | levantamo-nos |
| vós     | levantais-vos |
| eles/elas | levantam-se |

## Conclusion

Learning the rules of the verbs in Portuguese is vital for anyone who wants to speak the language fluently. If you're beginning to learn Portuguese, it's recommended that you start by mastering regular verbs, then move on to irregular and reflexive verbs.

With some practice and patience, you can quickly learn how to conjugate verbs in Portuguese and speak the language fluently.
