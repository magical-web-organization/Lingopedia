# Portuguese Indefinite Articles

In Portuguese, indefinite articles are used to indicate an unspecified or non-specific noun. They can be translated to English as "a" or "an." 

In Portuguese, there are two indefinite articles:

- **Um** (singular masculine)
- **Uma** (singular feminine)

## Usage

Indefinite articles are placed before a singular noun, and their gender and number must agree with the noun they modify. 

For example, "a book" in Portuguese would be "um livro" if the book is masculine, and "uma livro" if it is feminine.

### Examples:

- **Um carro.** (A car)
- **Uma bicicleta.** (A bicycle)
- **Um sorriso.** (A smile)
- **Uma história.** (A story)

## Exceptions

There are some exceptions to the rules for using indefinite articles. 

### Unchangeable Gender Nouns

In Portuguese, there are some nouns that have an unchangeable gender. For example:

- **O laranja** (The orange)
- **A manga** (The mango)

In these cases, the indefinite article is used according to the gender of the noun. So, it would be "uma laranja" and "um manga."

### Nouns Starting with a Vowel

When a noun begins with a vowel, the indefinite article "um" changes to "um".

For example, instead of "um avião," it is "um avião" and instead of "uma árvore," it is "uma árvore."

## Conclusion

Indefinite articles in Portuguese are used to indicate an unspecified or non-specific noun, and they must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. There are some exceptions to the rules, such as unchangeable gender nouns and nouns beginning with a vowel. Practice is key in mastering the usage of Portuguese indefinite articles.
