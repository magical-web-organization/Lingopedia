# Portuguese Definite Articles

Definite articles are used to refer to a specific noun. In Portuguese, there are four definite articles: o, a, os, and as. The choice of which article to use depends on the gender and number of the noun. 

## Gender

Portuguese nouns are either masculine or feminine. Masculine nouns use the articles "o" or "os", while feminine nouns use "a" or "as". 

For example:

- O livro (the book) - masculine singular
- A caneta (the pen) - feminine singular
- Os livros (the books) - masculine plural
- As canetas (the pens) - feminine plural

## Number

Portuguese nouns can be singular or plural. The definite articles also change depending on whether the noun is singular or plural.

For example:

- O livro (the book) - masculine singular
- Os livros (the books) - masculine plural

## Contractions

In Portuguese, the definite articles can also be contracted with certain prepositions. The most common contractions are "de + o = do" and "de + a = da". 

For example:

- O carro do meu pai (my father's car)
- A casa da minha mãe (my mother's house)

## Exceptions

Like all languages, Portuguese also has some exceptions to the rules. One common exception is with geographical locations. In Portuguese, geographical locations use the definite article even if they are singular.

For example:

- A França (France)
- O Brasil (Brazil)
