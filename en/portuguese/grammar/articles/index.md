The Portuguese language has two types of articles: the definite article and the indefinite article. Articles are used to indicate if a noun is specifically identified or if it is a general reference.

### Definite Articles

Definite articles (in Portuguese "artigos definidos") indicate a specific and known noun. There are four definite articles in Portuguese:
- "o" for masculine singular nouns
- "a" for feminine singular nouns
- "os" for masculine plural nouns
- "as" for feminine plural nouns

Examples:
- "O cachorro" (The dog)
- "A gata" (The cat)
- "Os carros" (The cars)
- "As mesas" (The tables)

### Indefinite Articles

Indefinite articles (in Portuguese "artigos indefinidos") indicate a noun that is not specifically identified. There are two indefinite articles in Portuguese:
- "um" for masculine singular nouns
- "uma" for feminine singular nouns

Examples:
- "Um gato" (A cat)
- "Uma mesa" (A table)

### Exceptions

There are some exceptions to the use of articles in the Portuguese language. For example, professions and nationalities do not require an article when used in a general sense. 

Examples:
- "Maria é médica" (Maria is a doctor)
- "Ele é português" (He is Portuguese)

With the exception of some regional dialects, Portuguese does not use the article before possessive pronouns.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, articles in the Portuguese language serve to indicate if a noun is specifically identified or if it is a general reference. Knowing when to use the definite and indefinite articles can greatly improve your Portuguese language skills.
