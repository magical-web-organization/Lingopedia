## How to Use Adverbs to Modify Sentences

Adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs in a sentence. The placement of the adverb may change depending on what it is modifying. Here are some examples:

1. Modifying Verbs

Adverbs that modify verbs in Portuguese usually come after the verb. For example:

- Ele caminha lentamente. (He walks slowly.)
- Eu canto bem. (I sing well.)

2. Modifying Adjectives

Adverbs that modify adjectives come before the adjectives they are modifying. For example:

- Ela é muito bonita. (She is very beautiful.)
- Ele é pouco amigo. (He is not very friendly.)

3. Modifying Other Adverbs

Adverbs that modify other adverbs in Portuguese usually come before the adverb they are modifying. For example:

- Ela fala muito rapidamente. (She speaks very rapidly.)
- Ele toca piano muito bem. (He plays the piano very well.)

In the above examples, the adverbs “muito,” “pouco,” and “muito” are modifying the verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, respectively.
