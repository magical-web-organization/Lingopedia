The Portuguese language has a complex system of adverb placement in sentences. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives or other adverbs. In Portuguese, adverbs can be placed before or after the verb, and in some cases, they can also be placed at the beginning or end of the sentence.

Here are the rules for the placement of adverbs in Portuguese:

1. Adverbs that modify verbs:
   Adverbs that modify verbs usually come after the verb. For example:
   - Eu falo português bem. (I speak Portuguese well.)
   - Ele canta lindamente. (He sings beautifully.)

   However, if the sentence has an object pronoun, the adverb should be placed before the verb. For example: 
   - Eu o conheço bem. (I know him well.)
   - Ela me ama verdadeiramente. (She truly loves me.)

2. Adverbs that modify adjectives:
   Adverbs that modify adjectives usually come before the adjective. For example: 
   - Ele é extremamente cuidadoso. (He is extremely careful.)
   - A casa é muito grande. (The house is very big.)

3. Adverbs that modify other adverbs:
   Adverbs that modify other adverbs usually come before the adverb. For example: 
   - Ele canta muito bem. (He sings very well.)
   - Ela trabalha bastante tranquilamente. (She works quite calmly.)

4. Adverbs of time and frequency:
   Adverbs of time and frequency are often placed at the beginning of the sentence. For example:
   - Sempre acordo cedo. (I always wake up early.)
   - Hoje eu não vou trabalhar. (Today I'm not going to work.)

5. Adverbs of place:
   Adverbs of place are usually placed after the verb. For example:
   - Eu vou lá agora. (I'm going there now.)
   - Ela mora aqui perto. (She lives here nearby.)

6. Adverbs that express affirmation or negation:
   Adverbs that express affirmation or negation are usually placed at the beginning of the sentence. For example:
   - Sim, eu quero ajuda. (Yes, I want help.)
   - Não, eu não gosto disso. (No, I don't like that.)

In conclusion, the key to correctly placing adverbs in Portuguese is to understand the type of adverb being used and its function in the sentence. This will enable you to construct sentences that are grammatically sound and convey your intended meaning with clarity.
