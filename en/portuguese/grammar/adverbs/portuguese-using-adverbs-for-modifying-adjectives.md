Adverbs are an essential part of any language as they help to modify verbs, adjectives, or even other adverbs, allowing speakers to express different nuances in meaning. In Portuguese, adverbs can be especially helpful when used to modify adjectives. This is because they can help to express different degrees of intensity or emphasis, making a statement more specific, nuanced, and accurate. In this article, we'll explore how adverbs can be used to modify adjectives in Portuguese.

## Basic Rule for Using Adverbs to Modify Adjectives

The basic rule for using adverbs to modify adjectives in Portuguese is simple: the adverb that comes before the adjective will modify it. For example:

- Ela é **muito** bonita.
  - She is **very** beautiful.
- A comida está **deliciosamente** quente.
  - The food is **deliciously** hot.
- Ele está **extremamente** cansado.
  - He is **extremely** tired.

In each of these examples, the adverb precedes the adjective, modifying it and changing the overall meaning of the sentence. The adverbs *muito*, *deliciosamente*, and *extremadamente* all serve to emphasize the adjective and provide additional information about its degree or intensity.

## Common Portuguese Adverbs for Modifying Adjectives

So, what are some adverbs commonly used to modify adjectives in Portuguese? Here are a few examples:

- **Muito** (very, much)
  - Ela é muito bonita. (She is very beautiful.)
- **Bastante** (quite, rather, enough)
  - Ele é bastante alto. (He is rather tall.)
- **Realmente** (really, truly)
  - A comida está realmente deliciosa. (The food is really delicious.)
- **Extremamente** (extremely)
  - Ele ficou extremamente triste. (He became extremely sad.)
- **Absolutamente** (absolutely, completely)
  - Estou absolutamente convencido. (I am absolutely convinced.)
- **Totalmente** (totally, completely)
  - Eles estão totalmente enganados. (They are totally wrong.)

Using these adverbs in combination with adjectives allows Portuguese speakers to express a greater range of nuance and precision when describing people, things, or situations.

## Placement of Adverbs

In Portuguese, adverbs can be placed before or after the verb, or before or after the adjective they are modifying. However, there are some adverbs that have a specific placement, such as:

- **Só** (only)
  - Só quero um pouco de água. (I only want a little water.)
- **Também** (also)
  - Eu também gosto de bolo. (I also like cake.)
- **Bem** (well)
  - Ela fala bem português. (She speaks Portuguese well.)

It is important to note that, like in English, the placement of adverbs can affect the meaning of the sentence. For example, the adverb *também* can change the meaning of a sentence depending on where it is placed:

- Ele também comeu arroz com feijão.
  - He also ate rice and beans. (implies other people ate it too)
- Ele comeu arroz com feijão também.
  - He ate rice and beans too. (implies he ate something else too)

## Conclusion

Using adverbs to modify adjectives is an important part of expressing nuance and meaning in Portuguese. By providing additional information about degrees of intensity or emphasis, adverbs can help speakers be more specific, accurate, and nuanced in their statements. By understanding the basic rule for using adverbs with adjectives, Portuguese language learners can improve their speaking and writing skills and express themselves with more clarity and precision.
