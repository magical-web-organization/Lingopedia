In Portuguese, as in many Romance languages, nouns are categorized as either masculine or feminine. In this article, we will focus on Portuguese feminine nouns, including rules for gender and pluralization.

**Gender Rules**

Unlike in English, Portuguese nouns are either masculine or feminine, and their gender may not always be intuitive. There are some general rules to help you determine the gender of a noun, but there are also many exceptions.

- Nouns ending in –a are usually feminine. For example, a palavra (the word) and a casa (the house) are feminine nouns. 
- Nouns ending in –ção are usually feminine. For example, a preocupação (the concern) and a questão (the issue) are feminine nouns.
- Nouns ending in –dade are usually feminine. For example, a cidade (the city) and a liberdade (the freedom) are feminine nouns.
- Nouns ending in –gem are usually feminine. For example, a coragem (the courage) and a viagem (the journey) are feminine nouns.
- Nouns ending in –ão can be masculine or feminine, depending on the word. For example, o coração (the heart) is a masculine noun, but a emoção (the emotion) is a feminine noun.

**Pluralization Rules**

Feminine nouns follow certain rules when being pluralized in Portuguese. These rules differ depending on the noun ending, as follows:

- Nouns ending in –a change to –as in the plural. For example, a mesa (the table) becomes as mesas (the tables) in the plural.
- Nouns ending in –ção change to –ções in the plural. For example, a nação (the nation) becomes as nações (the nations) in the plural.
- Nouns ending in –dade change to –dades in the plural. For example, a cidade (the city) becomes as cidades (the cities) in the plural.
- Nouns ending in –gem change to –gens in the plural. For example, a viagem (the journey) becomes as viagens (the journeys) in the plural.

Some nouns have irregular plural forms, and they must be memorized. For example, a mão (the hand) becomes as mãos (the hands) in the plural.

**Exceptions**

As previously mentioned, there are many exceptions to these rules, and some nouns may not follow any discernible pattern. To learn the gender and plural forms of a specific noun, it’s important to consult a dictionary or language reference guide.

In conclusion, Portuguese feminine nouns have their own set of gender and pluralization rules, which can be helpful to learn as you build your Portuguese language skills. While some rules may follow a consistent pattern, it’s important to be aware of exceptions and to consult references as needed.
