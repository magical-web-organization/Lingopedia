In Portuguese, nouns are classified into two genders: masculine and feminine. The gender of a noun is usually determined by its ending. Words ending in "-o" are usually masculine, while those ending in "-a" are usually feminine. However, there are exceptions to this general rule, where the gender of the noun does not match its ending. These exceptions can cause confusion for Portuguese learners, but with some practice and understanding, they can be easily memorized.

Here is a list of some common exceptions:

### Masculine Nouns Ending in "-a"

1. `dia` (day) - Ex: "O dia está bonito hoje." (The day is beautiful today.)

2. `problema` (problem) - Ex: "O problema ainda não foi resolvido." (The problem has not been solved yet.)

3. `sistema` (system) - Ex: "Este sistema é muito complexo." (This system is very complex.)

### Feminine Nouns Ending in "-o"

1. `a foto` (the photo) - Ex: "A foto está no meu celular." (The photo is on my phone.)

2. `a moto` (the motorbike) - Ex: "Ela comprou uma moto nova." (She bought a new motorbike.)

3. `a radio` (the radio) - Ex: "A radio está muito alta." (The radio is too loud.)

### Masculine Nouns Ending in "-e"

1. `o mármore` (the marble) - Ex: "O mármore é uma pedra muito bonita." (Marble is a very beautiful stone.)

2. `o funileiro` (the tinsmith) - Ex: "O funileiro consertou meu teto ontem." (The tinsmith fixed my roof yesterday.)

3. `o lance` (the bid) - Ex: "Este é o último lance para este item." (This is the last bid for this item.)

### Feminine Nouns Ending in "-e"

1. `a chave` (the key) - Ex: "Você viu minha chave por ai?" (Did you see my key around here?)

2. `a tarde` (the afternoon) - Ex: "Às vezes eu trabalho à tarde." (Sometimes I work in the afternoon.)

3. `a sorte` (the luck) - Ex: "Eu tive sorte na vida." (I have been lucky in life.)

### Masculine Nouns Ending in "-ão"

1. `o coração` (the heart) - Ex: "Meu coração está acelerado." (My heart is racing.)

2. `o avião` (the airplane) - Ex: "O avião decolou atrasado." (The airplane took off late.)

3. `o leão` (the lion) - Ex: "O leão é o rei da selva." (The lion is the king of the jungle.)

### Feminine Nouns Ending in "-ão"

1. `a mão` (the hand) - Ex: "Minha mão está doendo." (My hand hurts.)

2. `a estação` (the station) - Ex: "A estação fica perto daqui." (The station is close by.)

3. `a nação` (the nation) - Ex: "A nação está unida pelo esporte." (The nation is united by sport.)

As you can see, there are many exceptions to the gender rule in Portuguese nouns. It is important, therefore, to learn the gender of each noun as you learn the word itself. Often, the gender of a noun must simply be memorized because there is no particular pattern or rule to its gender classification.

In conclusion, learning Portuguese can be challenging, especially when it comes to the gender of nouns. But with practice and diligence, you can master this aspect of the language and communicate fluently like a native speaker.
