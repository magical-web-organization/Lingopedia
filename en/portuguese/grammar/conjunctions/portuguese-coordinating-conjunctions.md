## Introduction

Coordinating conjunctions play a crucial role in connecting phrases, clauses, and sentences in Portuguese. These conjunctions coordinate two or more elements of the same grammatical status, such as words, phrases or clauses. In this article, we will learn about Portuguese coordinating conjunctions and how to use them correctly.

## Types of Coordinating Conjunctions

Portuguese has seven coordinating conjunctions, which are:

1. E (and)
2. Ou (or)
3. Mas (but)
4. Portanto (therefore)
5. Porém (however)
6. Logo (thus)
7. Todavia (yet)

## Usage of Coordinating Conjunctions

### E (and)

"E" is used to connect two or more elements of the same type. For example:

```
Eu gosto de erva-cidreira e camomila.
(I like lemon balm and chamomile.)
```

Here, "e" is used to connect two types of tea.

### Ou (or)

"Ou" is used to present a choice or alternative. For example:

```
Você quer chá ou café?
(Do you want tea or coffee?)
```

Here, "ou" is used to present two options from which the other person would have to choose.

### Mas (but)

"Mas" is used to create a contrast between two ideas. For example:

```
Eu gostaria de ir à festa, mas estou ocupado.
(I would like to go to the party, but I am busy.)
```

Here, "mas" is used to present a contrast between the desire to go to the party and the fact that the person is busy.

### Portanto (therefore)

"Portanto" is used to indicate a conclusion or result. For example:

```
Eu estudei muito, portanto passei no exame.
(I studied hard, therefore I passed the exam.)
```

Here, "portanto" is used to indicate the conclusion that the person passed the exam because they studied hard.

### Porém (however)

"Porém" is used to create a contrast between two ideas, as "mas". However, it is more formal and less commonly used in Brazilian Portuguese. For example:

```
Eu gostaria de ir à festa, porém estou ocupado.
(I would like to go to the party, however I am busy.)
```

### Logo (thus)

"Logo" is also used to indicate a conclusion or result. However, it is more immediate and abrupt than "portanto". For example:

```
Eu estou muito cansado, logo vou para casa.
(I am very tired, thus I am going home.)
```

Here, "logo" is used to indicate the immediate result of being very tired.

### Todavia (yet)

"Todavia" is used to create a contrast between two ideas, as "mas" and "porém". However, it is more formal and less commonly used in Brazilian Portuguese. For example:

```
Eu não gosto de chá, todavia, tomo às vezes.
(I do not like tea, yet I drink it sometimes.)
```

## Conclusion

Coordinating conjunctions are a vital component of Portuguese language structure. Knowing how to use them correctly can help you communicate more effectively in both oral and written communication. It is essential to understand the different types of conjunctions and the contexts in which they are best used. Mastery of Portuguese coordinating conjunctions is an important step to improving your Portuguese language proficiency.
