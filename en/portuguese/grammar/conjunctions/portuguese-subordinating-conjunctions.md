Portuguese is a complex language with a rich grammar. One of the most important concepts to understand in Portuguese grammar is the use of subordinating conjunctions. These connect dependent clauses (which do not make sense on their own) to independent clauses (which can stand alone as a sentence). In this article, we'll explore the world of Portuguese subordinating conjunctions and how they are used.

## What are subordinating conjunctions?

First, let's clarify what we mean by subordinating conjunctions. A conjunction is a word that connects two phrases or clauses. In Portuguese, there are two types of conjunctions: coordinating and subordinating.

Coordinating conjunctions connect independent clauses of equal grammatical weight. For example, "Eu gosto de ir ao cinema, mas não tenho tempo" (I like going to the cinema, but I don't have time). In this sentence, "mas" is a coordinating conjunction that connects two independent clauses.

Subordinating conjunctions, on the other hand, connect dependent (subordinate) clauses to independent clauses, creating a complex sentence. These clauses need each other to make sense, and the independent clause is the main idea while the dependent clause provides extra information.

## Common subordinating conjunctions in Portuguese

There are many subordinating conjunctions in Portuguese, but some of the most common ones include:

- **que**: indicates a fact or an opinion. For example, "Eu acho que é melhor irmos para casa agora" (I think it's better if we go home now).

- **se**: indicates a condition or possibility. For example, "Se eu tiver tempo, vou te ajudar" (if I have time, I will help you).

- **porque**: indicates a reason. For example, "Eu não fui à festa porque estava cansado" (I didn't go to the party because I was tired).

- **como**: indicates a way or manner. For example, "Eu estudo como se fosse o último dia" (I study as if it were the last day).

- **quando**: indicates a time or moment. For example, "Quando eu chegar em casa, vou descansar" (When I get home, I'm going to rest).

- **embora**: indicates a contrast. For example, "Embora ele tenha estudado, ficou reprovado" (although he studied, he failed).

## How to use subordinating conjunctions in Portuguese

In Portuguese, the word order can change depending on the conjunction used. When a subordinating conjunction is used, the dependent clause comes before the independent clause. For example, "Eu fui ao cinema porque eu gosto de filmes" (I went to the cinema because I like movies). In this example, the dependent clause "porque eu gosto de filmes" comes before the independent clause "eu fui ao cinema."

Another thing to keep in mind is that the conjugation of the verb changes in the dependent clause. The verb is conjugated in the subjunctive mood, which is a different verb tense used to express doubt or uncertainty. For example, "A menos que ele venha, não vamos sair" (unless he comes, we're not going out). In the dependent clause, "ele venha" is conjugated in the subjunctive mood, while "nós vamos sair" is in the indicative mood.

## Conclusion

Subordinating conjunctions are an essential part of Portuguese grammar, used to connect dependent clauses to independent clauses. They allow for complex sentences and can change the word order and verb conjugation. By mastering these conjunctions, you'll be able to speak and write more effectively in Portuguese.
