In Portuguese, indefinite adjectives are used to refer to something that is non-specific or not fully defined. The majority of indefinite adjectives in Portuguese are placed before the noun, just like in English, although there are a few exceptions. In this article, we explore Portuguese indefinite adjectives and how they are used in the language.

### Types of Indefinite Adjectives in Portuguese

There are three main types of indefinite adjectives in Portuguese: 

1. Algum/Alguma/Alguns/Algumas 
2. Todo/Toda/Todos/Todas
3. Qualquer

#### Algum/Alguma/Alguns/Algumas

The indefinite adjective "algum" is used to refer to a non-specific quantity or to express the idea of "some" or "any". It agrees with the gender and number of the noun it describes. 

- Exemplo: "Algumas pessoas gostam de chocolate." (Some people like chocolate.)

When used in negative sentences, "algum" changes to "nenhum", which means "none" or "not any". 

- Exemplo: "Não há nenhum bolinho na padaria." (There are no cupcakes at the bakery.)

#### Todo/Toda/Todos/Todas

The indefinite adjective "todo" refers to a whole or complete set, and is translated as "all" or "every". It also agrees with the gender and number of the noun it describes. 

- Exemplo: "Toda a gente devia ser feliz." (Everyone should be happy.)

When used with a specific time or period, it usually means "entire", as in "the entire day" or "the whole week".

- Exemplo: "Passei todo o dia a estudar." (I spent the entire day studying.)

#### Qualquer

The indefinite adjective "qualquer" refers to a non-specific item or thing, and is translated as "any" or "whatever". 

- Exemplo: "Posso comprar qualquer bolo da loja." (I can buy any cake from the store.)

### Placement of Indefinite Adjectives

In general, indefinite adjectives are placed before the noun they describe. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, especially with "algum" and "qualquer". 

For example, when "algum" is used in conjunction with "tipo", it can be placed after the noun: 

- Exemplo: "Podes oferecer-me um livro de algum tipo." (You can offer me a book of some kind.)

Similarly, "qualquer" can be placed after the noun in certain contexts, usually when there is a qualifying adjective before it. 

- Exemplo: "Preciso de um vestido vermelho qualquer." (I need any red dress.)

### Conclusion

Indefinite adjectives are an important part of Portuguese grammar. They allow speakers to describe non-specific or non-defined nouns, and they often agree in gender and number with the nouns they describe. By understanding the different types of indefinite adjectives and their placement, learners of Portuguese can better understand and use these adjectives in their own speaking and writing.
