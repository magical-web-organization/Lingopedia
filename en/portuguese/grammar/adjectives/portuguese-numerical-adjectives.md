# Portuguese Numerical Adjectives

Portuguese numerical adjectives are a crucial component of the language, allowing speakers to express quantities, order, and fractions. In this article, we will explore the basics of Portuguese numerical adjectives, including cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, and fractional numbers.

## Cardinal Numbers

Cardinal numbers in Portuguese are used to express quantity or amount. They can be used both as adjectives and as nouns. Here are the cardinal numbers from 0 to 10 in Portuguese:

| Number | Portuguese |
|--------|------------|
| 0      | zero       |
| 1      | um         |
| 2      | dois       |
| 3      | três       |
| 4      | quatro     |
| 5      | cinco      |
| 6      | seis       |
| 7      | sete       |
| 8      | oito       |
| 9      | nove       |
| 10     | dez        |

Note that the words for the numbers 1 and 2 change depending on gender and number. For example, "uma maçã" means "one apple" (feminine singular), while "dois carros" means "two cars" (masculine plural).

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers in Portuguese are used to express order or position. They are formed by adding -º to the cardinal number. Here are the ordinal numbers from 1 to 10 in Portuguese:

| Number | Portuguese    |
|--------|---------------|
| 1      | primeiro/ª   |
| 2      | segundo/ª    |
| 3      | terceiro/ª   |
| 4      | quarto/ª     |
| 5      | quinto/ª     |
| 6      | sexto/ª      |
| 7      | sétimo/ª     |
| 8      | oitavo/ª     |
| 9      | nono/ª       |
| 10     | décimo/ª     |

Note that the ordinal number changes to agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. For example, "o primeiro livro" means "the first book" (masculine singular), while "a segunda página" means "the second page" (feminine singular).

## Fractional Numbers

Fractional numbers in Portuguese are used to express a fraction of a whole. They are formed by using the ordinal number in the denominator and the cardinal number in the numerator. For example:

| Fraction | Portuguese    |
|----------|---------------|
| 1/2      | um meio      |
| 1/3      | um terço     |
| 1/4      | um quarto    |
| 1/5      | um quinto    |
| 1/6      | um sexto     |
| 1/7      | um sétimo    |
| 1/8      | um oitavo    |
| 1/9      | um nono      |
| 1/10     | um décimo    |

Note that the word for "half" (meio) is used for 1/2, while the other fractions are formed by adding -o to the ordinal number.

In conclusion, Portuguese numerical adjectives are an essential aspect of the language. By learning these basic elements, you'll be better equipped to communicate quantities, orders, and fractions in Portuguese.
