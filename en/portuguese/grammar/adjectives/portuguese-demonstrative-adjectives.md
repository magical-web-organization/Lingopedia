# Portuguese Demonstrative Adjectives

Demonstrative adjectives in Portuguese are words that indicate a person or object's proximity in relation to the speaker or listener. There are four demonstrative adjectives in Portuguese: **este**, **esse**, **aquele** and **aquilo**.

## Este and Essa

**Este** is used to indicate a noun that is close to the speaker. In contrast, **esse** is used to indicate a noun that is close to the listener. The difference between the two is easier to understand if you think about the perspective of each person.

Examples:

- **Este** carro é meu. (This car is mine - The car is close to the speaker)
- **Esta** camisa é bonita. (This shirt is pretty - The shirt is close to the speaker)
- **Esse** carro é seu. (That car is yours - The car is close to the listener)
- **Essa** camisa é grande. (That shirt is big - The shirt is close to the listener)

## Aquele and Aquilo

**Aquele** is used to indicate a noun that is far from both the speaker and listener. It can be translated as "that" in English. On the other hand, **aquilo** is used to refer to something in a vague or general way, like "that thing".

Examples:

- Ele mora naquela casa. (He lives in that house - The house is far from both the speaker and listener)
- Eu vi aquela pessoa ontem. (I saw that person yesterday - The person is far from both the speaker and listener)
- Eu não entendo aquilo. (I don't understand that - Referring to something in a general way)

## Gender and Number Agreement

Like most adjectives in Portuguese, demonstrative adjectives must agree in gender and number with the nouns they are modifying:

- Masculine singular: **este** (this), **esse** (that), **aquele** (that), **aquilo** (that)
- Feminine singular: **esta** (this), **essa** (that), **aquela** (that)
- Masculine plural: **estes** (these), **esses** (those), **aqueles** (those)
- Feminine plural: **estas** (these), **essas** (those), **aquelas** (those)

Examples:

- **Estes** meninos são meus amigos. (These boys are my friends)
- **Essas** meninas gostam de dançar. (Those girls like to dance)
- **Aqueles** sapatos são caros. (Those shoes are expensive)
- Eu não gosto **desta** comida. (I don't like this food)

## Conclusion

Demonstrative adjectives are essential in daily communication in Portuguese. Use **este** and **esse** to refer to objects that are close to the speaker and listener, respectively. Conversely, **aquele** and **aquilo** are used to refer to objects that are far from both the speaker and the listener. Always keep in mind gender and number agreement when using demonstrative adjectives in Portuguese.
