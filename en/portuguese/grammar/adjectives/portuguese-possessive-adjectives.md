## Introduction

Possessive adjectives are words that indicate ownership or possession of an object, person, or place. In Portuguese, possessive adjectives are used to show who owns or possesses the object, person, or place.

## Forms of Possessive Adjectives

Portuguese possessive adjectives are similar to English possessive adjectives in form. They agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. However, Portuguese possessive adjectives are placed before the noun they modify, unlike English where they come after the noun.

The forms of Portuguese possessive adjectives are:

| Singular | Masculine | Feminine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | meu | minha |
| 2nd person - informal | teu | tua |
| 2nd person - formal | seu | sua |
| 3rd person | seu | sua |

| Plural | Masculine | Feminine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | nossos | nossas |
| 2nd person - informal | vossos | vossas |
| 2nd person - formal | seus | suas |
| 3rd person | seus | suas |

## Usage

Portuguese possessive adjectives are used in many situations. They can be used to show ownership or possession of a person or thing, as well as to refer to family relationships.

1. Ownership or possession:

    - É a minha casa. (It's my house.)
    - O meu carro está na garagem. (My car is in the garage.)
    - A minha bolsa é azul. (My purse is blue.)

2. Family relationships:

    - A minha mãe é alta. (My mother is tall.)
    - O meu irmão é mais novo que eu. (My brother is younger than me.)
    - A minha esposa é linda. (My wife is beautiful.)

3. General use:

    - Os seus sapatos estão na entrada. (Your shoes are in the entryway.)
    - A nossa família é grande. (Our family is big.)

## Differences from English Possessive Adjectives

Portuguese possessive adjectives differ from English possessive adjectives in a few key ways. Firstly, as mentioned, Portuguese possessive adjectives come before the noun, whereas in English they come after. Secondly, Portuguese possessive adjectives change to agree with the gender and number of the noun, whereas in English they remain the same. Lastly, Portuguese possessive adjectives are often used where English would use the definite article.

For example:

- English: The book is mine.
- Portuguese: O livro é meu. (The book is mine.)

Similarly:

- English: I like her dress.
- Portuguese: Eu gosto do vestido dela. (I like her dress.)
