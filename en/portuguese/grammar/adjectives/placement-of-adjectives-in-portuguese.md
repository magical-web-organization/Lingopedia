Adjectives are an essential part of any language, and Portuguese is no exception. Adjectives are words that describe the characteristics of a noun. In Portuguese, adjectives are placed after the noun they describe, with a few exceptions. In this article, we will discuss the rules and exceptions for placing adjectives in Portuguese sentences.

## The basic rule

The basic rule for placing adjectives in Portuguese is to put them after the noun they describe. For example, "a casa grande" means "the big house." The adjective "grande" comes after the noun "casa" it describes.

## Exceptions to the rule

While the basic rule is to place the adjective after the noun in Portuguese, there are several exceptions to this rule. Let's take a look at some of the common exceptions.

### Adjectives that denote nationalities

When an adjective denotes nationality, it is usually placed before the noun it describes. For example, "a comida brasileira" means "Brazilian food." The adjective "brasileira" comes before the noun "comida" it describes.

### Adjectives that indicate quantity, shape, or size

When an adjective indicates quantity, shape, or size, it can come before or after the noun it describes. For example, "A bola pequena" means "The small ball" and "A pequena bola" also means "The small ball"

### Adjectives used to express a subjective opinion

When an adjective expresses a subjective opinion, it can come either before or after the noun it describes, depending on the intended emphasis. For example, "O lindo pôr do sol" means "The beautiful sunset" and "O pôr do sol lindo" means "The sunset that is beautiful."

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the basic rule for placing adjectives in Portuguese is to put them after the noun they describe. However, there are several exceptions to this rule, such as adjectives that denote nationalities, specify quantities, shapes, or sizes and those that express subjective opinions. It is important to keep these exceptions in mind, as they can significantly affect the meaning of a sentence.
