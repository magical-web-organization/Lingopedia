Prepositions are essential elements in any language, and Portuguese is no exception. They’re words that establish relationships between different parts of a sentence, like nouns, pronouns, and verbs. In Portuguese, prepositions are a fundamental component of everyday conversation, and their correct use can make a big difference in how you're perceived by native speakers.

## Types of Portuguese prepositions

Portuguese prepositions can be classified into different types, depending on their role in a sentence. Here are some of the most common examples:

### Prepositions of time

These prepositions indicate when an action occurs. Some of the most common ones are:

- **em** (in)
- **de** (from)
- **a** (to, until)
- **na** (on)
- **durante** (during)

For example:

- Eu vou para o Brasil em dezembro. (I'm going to Brazil in December.)
- Ele estuda inglês de manhã. (He studies English in the morning.)
- Eu vou ficar em casa até às 9 horas. (I'm going to stay at home until 9 o'clock.)

- **em** (in, at)

For example:
