Prepositions are an essential aspect of any language as they help convey meaning and emphasize relationships between words in sentences. In Portuguese, there are several prepositions used to express time, and understanding them is crucial for effective communication.

Here are some of the most commonly used Portuguese prepositions of time:

## Durante

Durante is a preposition used to indicate the duration of an event or action. It typically translates to "during" in English.

**Example:** Durante as férias, eu viajei para o exterior. (During the holidays, I traveled abroad.)

## Até

Até is another preposition used to denote a duration, but it has a more precise meaning. It indicates the end of an event or action.

**Example:** Eu estudarei até as 22h. (I will study until 10 pm.)

## Desde

Desde is used to indicate the start of an event or action. It often translates to "since" or "from" in English.

**Example:** Eu moro aqui desde 2010. (I have been living here since 2010.)

## Até que

Até que is similar to the preposition até, but it emphasizes the duration leading up to an event. It often translates to "until" or "up to" in English.

**Example:** Eu trabalhei até que o sol se pôs. (I worked until the sun set.)

## De

De is a preposition used to describe a time range. It is commonly used to indicate the time of day.

**Example:** Eu acordo entre as 6 e as 7 da manhã. (I wake up between 6 and 7 in the morning.)

## Em

Em is another preposition used to describe a time range, but it adds specificity to the time. It is often used to indicate months or years.

**Example:** Eu nasci em junho de 2000. (I was born in June 2000.)

## Para

Para often translates to "by" or "for" and is used to indicate a deadline or when something is expected to happen.

**Example:** Eu preciso terminar este projeto para a semana que vem. (I need to finish this project by next week.)

## Antes

Antes is a preposition used to indicate an event that occurs before another. It often translates to "before" in English.

**Example:** Eu sempre durmo antes das 23h. (I always sleep before 11 pm.)

## Depois

Depois is a preposition used to indicate an event that occurs after another. It often translates to "after" in English.

**Example:** Eu gosto de sair depois das 18h. (I like to go out after 6 pm.)

In summary, prepositions of time are vital to expressing duration, start and end times, and order of events. By understanding and utilizing these prepositions, you can improve your Portuguese language skills and effectively communicate about time.
