Prepositions of manner are words in a sentence that describe how an action is done, for example, by walking, running, or speaking. In the Portuguese language, prepositions of manner are essential in describing an action or process that is taking place. There are several prepositions of manner, and this article will highlight some of the most crucial ones.

### Por

The preposition "por" is used to describe the method or means of carrying out an action. For instance, if one wishes to describe how they arrived at a particular location, they could say, "Cheguei aqui por carro" (I arrived here by car).

Another instance is when one describes physical activity, for example, "Ela correu por uma hora" (she ran for an hour). In this case, the word "por" is used to indicate the duration of the activity.

### Com

The preposition "com" in Portuguese is commonly used to describe how an action is done using a tool or instrument. For example, "Eu escrevo com uma caneta" (I write with a pen).

In some cases, "com" can also be used to describe the way a person performs an action. For instance, "Ele canta com emoção" (he sings with emotion).

### De

The preposition "de" in Portuguese is used to describe the nature of an action in terms of quality. For example, "Ela falou de maneira amigável" (she spoke in a friendly manner).

Another way to use the preposition "de" is to denote the purpose or intention of an action. For instance, "Eu saí de casa para comprar pão" (I left the house to buy bread).

### Em

The preposition "em" is used to indicate the medium or way something is done. For example, "Ela assiste TV em espanhol" (she watches TV in Spanish).

"Em" can also be used to describe how a person walks or moves in a particular way. For instance, "Ela caminhou em silêncio" (she walked silently).

### A

The preposition "a" in Portuguese is used to describe how an action is done in a specific manner. For example, "Ela comeu a pizza com garfo e faca" (she ate the pizza with a knife and fork).

Another way to use "a" is to describe the inflection or tone of voice in which an action is taken, for example, "Ele riu alegremente" (he laughed happily).

### Conclusion

Prepositions of manner in Portuguese are essential in describing an action or process that is taking place. Each preposition has a specific use and gives more detail to the sentence, making it more comprehensive. Understanding the different prepositions of manner is, therefore, crucial in mastering the Portuguese language.
