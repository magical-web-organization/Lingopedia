The Portuguese language is a Romance language spoken by approximately 220 million people worldwide, with the majority of speakers residing in Portugal, Brazil, and Angola. The Portuguese alphabet consists of 26 letters, the same as the English alphabet. However, there are a few differences in pronunciation and the use of diacritics.

### The Portuguese Alphabet

Here are the 26 letters of the Portuguese alphabet in their correct order:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V X W Y Z

As you can see, the Portuguese alphabet is similar to the English alphabet, but with a few letters missing. The letters K, W, and Y are only used in loanwords and foreign words.

### Pronunciation

Each letter of the Portuguese alphabet has its own unique pronunciation. Here are the basic sounds for each letter:

- A: "ah"
- B: "beh"
- C: "ceh" (Before "e" or "i", it sounds like an "s")
- D: "deh"
- E: "eh"
- F: "effeh"
- G: "jeh" (Before "e" or "i", it sounds like a soft "zh")
- H: "ahgah" (silent in most words)
- I: "ee"
- J: "zheh"
- L: "ehle"
- M: "ehme"
- N: "ehne"
- O: "oh"

- S: "ehsseh"
- T: "teh"
- U: "oo"
- V: "veh"
- X: "sh"
- Z: "zeh"

### Diacritics

In addition to the 26 letters of the alphabet, Portuguese also uses diacritics to modify the pronunciation of certain vowels. There are five different diacritics used in Portuguese:

- Acute accent (´) - used on vowels to indicate stress on the last syllable of a word, as in "pára" (stop)
- Grave accent (`) - used on certain vowels to indicate stress on the second-to-last syllable of a word, as in "café" (coffee)
- Tilde (~) - used on vowels to indicate nasalization, as in "ão" (big)
- Cedilla (Ç) - used on "C" to indicate that it should be pronounced "ss" when followed by "a", "o", or "u", as in "açucar" (sugar)
- Circumflex (^) - used on certain vowels to indicate a contraction, as in "pôde" (was able to)

### Conclusion

Learning the Portuguese alphabet and pronunciation is an important step in the process of mastering the language. Once you have gotten the hang of the basic sounds and diacritics, you can begin to work on sentence structure and grammar, and eventually become fluent in Portuguese.
