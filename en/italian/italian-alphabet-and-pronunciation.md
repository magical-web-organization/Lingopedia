### C and G

These letters have different sounds based on their position in a word.

### H

In Italian, the letter H is always silent and has no sound.

### R

The letter R has a rolled or trilled sound in Italian and is pronounced by fluttering the tongue against the roof of the mouth.

### S and Z

The Italian S and Z are pronounced more or less the same as in English. The only difference is that the Italian Z is pronounced as [dz].

## Accent Marks

Italian accent marks are used to indicate the stress of a word or distinguish word meanings. There are three types of accent marks in Italian: 

- Acute accent (´): placed on a vowel to indicate a stressed syllable, such as in città (pronounced CHEE-ta)
- Grave accent (`): placed on a vowel to indicate a closed, unaccented sound, such as in città (pronounced CHEE-ta)
- Circumflex accent (^): placed on a vowel to indicate a closed sound and distinguish word meanings, such as in fà 'to make' and fa 'he/she/it makes'.
