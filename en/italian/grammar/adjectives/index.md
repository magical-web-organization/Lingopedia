When learning a new language, one of the fundamental areas to master is the use of adjectives. Italian adjectives are an essential part of the language and are used to describe nouns or pronouns. They can be used to describe physical characteristics, emotions, and attributes of a person, place or thing.

Adjectives in Italian are known for their flexibility, as they can be placed both before and after the noun. In Italian grammar, the adjective must agree with the gender and number of the noun it modifies. Therefore, it is essential to learn the gender and number of the nouns to use the correct adjective. 

In Italian, adjectives can belong to one of two types: descriptive adjectives and limiting adjectives.

#### Descriptive Adjectives
Descriptive adjectives are used to describe the qualities of the nouns they modify, such as size, color, shape, and beauty. For example:

- La casa grande - The big house
- La macchina rossa - The red car
- Il vestito nuovo - The new dress

As we can see in the examples, descriptive adjectives agree in number and gender with the noun they modify.

#### Limiting Adjectives
Limiting adjectives, also known as determiners, are used to limit the meaning of the noun they modify. They indicate the quantity, identity, or possession of the noun. Some common limiting adjectives in Italian are:

- Uno - One ( masculine)
- Una - One ( feminine)
- I - The ( masculine)
- Le - The ( feminine)
- Mio/ mia - My ( masculine/feminine)

Here are some examples of limiting adjectives in use:

- Una pizza margherita, per favore - One margherita pizza, please 
- I libri sono sulla mensola - The books are on the shelf
- Mia madre cucina molto bene - My mother cooks very well
