# Italian Definite Articles

In the Italian language, definite articles are used to refer to specific nouns. Unlike English, Italian often uses definite articles with proper nouns and nouns in general. Definite articles in Italian have four forms: 

- *Il* (masculine singular)
- *Lo* (masculine singular before words that start with z, gn, s + consonant, ps, or x)
- *La* (feminine singular)
- *I* (masculine plural)
- *Le* (feminine plural)

## When to Use Definite Articles

Definite articles in Italian are used in the following situations:

### With General Nouns

Italian often uses definite articles with general nouns, unlike English. For example: 

- *Il libro è sulla scrivania.* (The book is on the desk.)
- *La macchina è rossa.* (The car is red.)
- *I fiori sono belli.* (The flowers are beautiful.)
- *Le scarpe sono nere.* (The shoes are black.)

### With Proper Nouns

Italian uses definite articles with proper nouns to indicate a specific person or thing. For example:

Italian uses definite articles with days of the week and parts of the day. For example:
