# Italian Language: Articles

The Italian language uses articles, which are small words that come before nouns and help to clarify the meaning of the noun. There are three articles in Italian: definite articles, indefinite articles, and partitive articles.

## Definite Articles

Definite articles refer to specific nouns and can be translated to “the” in English. In Italian, there are different forms of the definite article depending on the gender and number of the noun.

### Masculine

Use "il" for singular masculine nouns beginning with a consonant, e.g. "il libro" (the book).

Use "lo" for singular masculine nouns beginning with "s + consonant" or "z", e.g. "lo studente" (the student), "lo zaino" (the backpack).
