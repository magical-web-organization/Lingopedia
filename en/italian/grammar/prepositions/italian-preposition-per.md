## Introduction

The Italian preposition "per" is a very common word, used in different contexts and with different meanings. In this article, we will analyze its usage, highlighting the main nuances and differences between the various forms.

## Meanings of "per"

The preposition "per" can be translated into English with several different words, depending on the context. Among the possible meanings, we find:

- "for"
- "to"
- "by"
- "through"
- "in order to"

The specific meaning of "per" can often be inferred from the context, so let's see some examples.

### "For"

When "per" is used to indicate the recipient of an action or a gift, it can be translated as "for". For example:

- Ho comprato un regalo per mia madre. (I bought a present for my mother.)
- Ho fatto questo lavoro per te. (I did this job for you.)

In these cases, "per" is often followed by a noun, indicating the beneficiary of the action.

### "To"

"Per" can also be used to express a destination or a direction of movement, and in this case, it can be translated as "to". For example:

- Vado a Parigi per le vacanze. (I'm going to Paris for the holidays.)
- Questa strada è pericolosa per i pedoni. (This road is dangerous for pedestrians.)

In these cases, "per" often indicates the endpoint of a journey or the direction of a movement.

### "By"

When "per" is used to indicate the means or the instrument of an action or a process, it can be translated as "by". For example:

- Questo dipinto è stato fatto per mezzo di pennelli e colori. (This painting was made by means of brushes and colors.)
- L'hanno arrestato per ordine del giudice. (He was arrested by order of the judge.)

In these cases, "per" is often followed by a noun indicating the tool or the agent of the action.

### "Through"

"Per" can also be used to indicate a passage or a transition through something, and in this case, it can be translated as "through". For example:

- Il treno passa per la stazione di Bologna. (The train passes through the station of Bologna.)
- Ho letto questo libro per intero. (I read this book through and through.)

In these cases, "per" often indicates a path or a step that leads to a goal.

### "In order to"

Finally, "per" can be used to express a purpose or an objective, and in this case, it can be translated as "in order to". For example:

- Ho studiato molto per superare l'esame. (I studied a lot in order to pass the exam.)
- Abbiamo comprato questa macchina per risparmiare sui costi. (We bought this car in order to save on costs.)

In these cases, "per" often indicates the motivation or the reason behind an action or a decision.
