# Italian Preposition: Con

When learning Italian, prepositions are essential parts of the language that you can't afford to ignore. They dictate the relationships between different elements of a sentence, like subjects and objects, and provide context to what's happening. One such preposition that you will come across in your journey to learn Italian is "con," which is best translated as "with" in English. Here is everything you need to know about this important preposition.

## Usage

One of the most important things to understand about "con" is that it can be used in many different contexts. This makes it a versatile preposition that you can use in numerous scenarios. Here are some of the ways you can utilize "con":

- **Accompaniment:** This is the most common usage of "con." It implies that two or more people or things are doing something together. For example: "Vado al cinema con Luca" (I am going to the cinema with Luca).
- **Tools or instruments:** If you're doing something with the help of a tool or instrument, you can use "con" to express that idea. For example: "Taglio la pizza con un coltello" (I am cutting the pizza with a knife).
- **Manner:** You can also use "con" when describing the way you're doing something. For example: "Mangio la zuppa con un cucchiaio" (I am eating the soup with a spoon).
- **Quantity:** "Con" can also be used in sentences to denote how many people, animals, or things took part in an event, usually with the verb "essere" or "avere" in the sentence. For example: "Siamo in classe con venti studenti" (We are in class with 20 students).

## Examples:

Let us look at some sentences where "con" is used in different ways.

- "Vivo con mia madre" (I live with my mother) This sentence indicates the accompaniment.
- "Scrivo con la penna" (I write with the pen) This sentence indicates the use of a tool or instrument.
- "Parlo con calma" (I speak calmly) This sentence indicates the manner.
- "Ho letto il libro con grande piacere" (I read the book with great pleasure) This sentence indicates the quantity.

## Exceptions

Like with most rules, there are exceptions, and "con" is no different. Here are a few important exceptions to keep in mind.

- **People:** When you're talking about someone's personality or their personal relationship, you cannot use "con." For instance, you would not say, "Sono felice con Luca." Instead, you would use "di" to say "Sono felice di Luca."
- **Places:** "Con" is not used when talking about the place where something is happening. For example, you cannot say, "Vado al cinema con cinema." Instead, you should use "in" to say, "Vado al cinema in via Roma."

## Conclusion

It is highly versatile and has various uses, ranging from accompaniment to quantity. Although there might be a few exceptions to keep in mind, they are easy to manage with regular practice.
