In Italian, subordinating conjunctions are words that connect two clauses, with one dependent on the other. They link a subordinate clause to a main clause, creating complex sentences. Understanding and mastering Italian subordinating conjunctions is essential for achieving fluency and expressing complex ideas.

In this article, we’ll discuss some of the most common Italian subordinating conjunctions and their uses.

## Che

Che is a multi-purpose subordinating conjunction in Italian. It can be used to introduce a noun, an adjective or a clause. The main function of che is to express that something depends on something else.

Example:

*Ho bisogno di soldi che mi permettano di andare in vacanza* (I need money that will allow me to go on vacation)

In this sentence, che introduces a subordinate clause which explains the need for money. 

## Perché

Perché is equivalent to "because" in English. It is used to explain the reason why the main clause is true.

Example:

*Non esco perché piove* (I’m not going out because it's raining)

In this case, perché explains the reason why the speaker won't go outside. 

## Quando

Quando means "when" and it refers to a specific moment in time in the subordinate clause.

Example:

*Vado in palestra quando ho tempo* (I go to the gym when I have time)

In this sentence, quando introduces a subordinate clause which specifies when the speaker goes to the gym.

## Se

Se means "if" and it is used to express a condition. The main clause will only happen if the subordinate clause is true.

Example:

*Se non piove, usciamo* (If it doesn't rain, we'll go out)

In this sentence, se introduces a subordinate clause that conditions the decision to go out.

## Affinché

Affinché conveys purpose. It indicates the purpose of the action or state indicated in the main clause.

Example:

*Studia tanto affinché riesca ad ottenere una buona votazione* (Study hard so that you can get a good grade)

In this sentence, affinché introduces the purpose of studying hard.

## Conclusion

Italian subordinating conjunctions are essential for creating complex sentences and communicating complex ideas. By mastering these conjunctions, you'll be able to add depth and nuance to your written and spoken language. 

Practice using these conjunctions in context to gain familiarity with their meanings and function. With time, you'll become a fluent and expressive Italian speaker.
