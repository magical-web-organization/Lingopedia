# Italian Personal Pronouns

If you are learning Italian, one of the first things you will need to master is personal pronouns. Pronouns are words used to refer to a person or thing without using their name or description. In Italian, personal pronouns come in different forms depending on their function in the sentence.

## Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns are used to indicate who is performing the action in the sentence. In Italian, there are seven subject pronouns:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| io | I |
| tu | you |
| lui | he |
| lei | she |
| Lei | you (formal) |
| noi | we |
| voi | you all |
| loro | they |

## Object Pronouns

Object pronouns are used to indicate the object of the action in the sentence. In Italian, object pronouns have different forms depending on whether they are direct or indirect objects.

### Direct Object Pronouns

Direct object pronouns are used to replace the noun that receives the action of the verb directly. In Italian, the direct object pronouns are:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| mi | me |
| ti | you |
| lo / la | him / her |
| ci | us |
| vi | you all |
| li / le | them |

### Indirect Object Pronouns

Indirect object pronouns are used to indicate to whom or for whom the action of the verb is performed. In Italian, the indirect object pronouns are:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| mi | to / for me |
| ti | to / for you |
| gli / le | to / for him / her |
| ci | to / for us |
| vi | to / for you all |
| loro | to / for them |

## Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession or ownership. In Italian, the possessive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun they replace. The Italian possessive pronouns are:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| il mio / la mia | my |
| il tuo / la tua | your |
| il suo / la sua | his / her / its |
| il nostro / la nostra | our |
| il vostro / la vostra | your all's |
| il loro / la loro | their |

## Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are used to indicate that the subject of the sentence is also the object. In other words, the subject is performing the action on itself. In Italian, reflexive pronouns are formed by adding the reflexive particle "si" to the object pronoun. The Italian reflexive pronouns are:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| mi | myself |
| ti | yourself |
| si | himself / herself / itself |
| ci | ourselves |
| vi | yourselves |
| si | themselves |
