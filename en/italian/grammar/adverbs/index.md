# Italian Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs in a sentence. They typically provide more information about how, when, where, and to what extent something is happening. In Italian, adverbs are an essential part of speech, as they add depth and nuance to language.

## Types of Adverbs in Italian

1. **Adverbs of Manner:** These adverbs describe how an action is performed. For example, "*velocemente*" (quickly) and "*gentilmente*" (kindly).

2. **Adverbs of Time:** These adverbs describe when an action is performed or how often it happens. For example, "*ieri*" (yesterday), "*spesso* (often), and "*mai*" (never).

3. **Adverbs of Place:** These adverbs describe where an action takes place. For example, "*qui*" (here), "*lì*" (there), and "*fuori*" (outside).

4. **Adverbs of Degree:** These adverbs describe the degree or intensity of an action or situation. For example, "*molto*" (very), "*abbastanza*" (enough), and "*poco*" (little).

5. **Interrogative Adverbs:** These adverbs are used to ask questions about a specific detail in a sentence. For example, "*come*" (how), "*dove*" (where), and "*quando*" (when).

6. **Relative Adverbs:** These adverbs are used to connect clauses or phrases in a sentence. For example, "*dove*" (where), "*perché*" (why), and "*quando*" (when).

For example:
