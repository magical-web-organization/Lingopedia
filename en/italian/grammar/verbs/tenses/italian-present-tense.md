## What is Italian Present Tense?

The Italian present tense (presente) is used to describe actions, events or states which are happening or still ongoing in the present. It is the most used tense in Italian language, and is relatively simple to form, especially when compared to other Italian tenses.

## Formation

The present tense form is formed by taking the infinitive form of a verb and adding the appropriate ending. Italian verbs are divided into three groups, depending on the ending they have in the infinitive form:

**First Group: -are Verbs**

To form the present tense for verbs ending in the infinitive in -are, simply remove the -are ending and add one of the endings below:

- io (I) : -o
- tu (you): -i
- lui/lei (he/she): -a
- noi (we): -iamo
- voi (you all): -ate
- loro (they): -ano

For example:

| Infinitive | Present Tense | English |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| parlare (to speak) | io parlo | I speak |
| parlare (to speak) | tu parli | You speak |
| parlare (to speak) | lui/lei parla | He/She speaks |
| parlare (to speak) | noi parliamo | We speak |
| parlare (to speak) | voi parlate | You all speak |
| parlare (to speak) | loro parlano | They speak |

**Second Group: -ere Verbs**

To form the present tense for verbs ending in the infinitive in -ere, simply remove the -ere ending and add one of the endings below:

- io (I) : -o
- tu (you): -i
- lui/lei (he/she): -e
- noi (we): -iamo
- voi (you all): -ete
- loro (they): -ono

For example:

| Infinitive | Present Tense | English |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| vedere (to see) | io vedo | I see |
| vedere (to see) | tu vedi | You see |
| vedere (to see) | lui/lei vede | He/She sees |

| vedere (to see) | voi vedete | You all see |
| vedere (to see) | loro vedono | They see |


**Third Group: -ire Verbs**

To form the present tense for verbs ending in the infinitive in -ire, simply remove the -ire ending and add one of the endings below:

- io (I) : -isco
- tu (you): -isci
- lui/lei (he/she): -isce
- noi (we): -iamo
- voi (you all): -ite
- loro (they): -iscono

For example:

| dormire (to sleep) | io dormo | I sleep |
| dormire (to sleep) | tu dormi | You sleep |
| dormire (to sleep) | lui/lei dorme | He/She sleeps |
