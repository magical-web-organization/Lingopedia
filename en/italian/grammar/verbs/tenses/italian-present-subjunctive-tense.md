# Italian Present Subjunctive Tense

The Italian present subjunctive tense is a mood that is used to express doubt, uncertainty, desire, necessity, or emotion. It is mostly used in subordinate clauses, after certain verbs and expressions, and in set phrases.

## Formation

The present subjunctive tense is formed by taking the root of the present tense, adding the appropriate endings, and changing the vowels in some cases.

|     Pronoun     |     Ending     |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|
|       Io        |        -i       |
|      Tu        |       -a        |
|       Egli/Ella       |       -a        |
|      Noi       |       -iamo       |
|     Voi      |        -iate      |
|      Essi/Esse      |      -ano        |

### Regular Verbs

To form the present subjunctive tense for regular verbs, follow these steps:

1. Take the root of the present tense. For example, for the verb "parlare" (to speak), the root is "parl-".
2. Add the appropriate endings. For example, for the pronoun "io", the ending is "-i". So, "parlare" in the present subjunctive tense for "io" is "parli".
3. Change the vowel in some cases. For example, for the pronoun "tu", the ending is "-a", but if the verb ends in "-care" or "-gare", the ending is "-chi" or "-ghi" to preserve the hard "c" or "g". So, "parlare" in the present subjunctive tense for "tu" is "parli".

### Irregular Verbs

There are several irregular verbs in the present subjunctive tense that do not follow the regular rules. Some examples include:

- Essere (to be): sia, sia, sia, siamo, siate, siano
- Avere (to have): abbia, abbia, abbia, abbiamo, abbiate, abbiano
- Fare (to do/make): faccia, faccia, faccia, facciamo, facciate, facciano
- Andare (to go): vada, vada, vada, andiamo, andiate, vadano

## Usage

The present subjunctive tense is used in a variety of situations, including:

### Doubt or Uncertainty

When expressing doubt or uncertainty, the present subjunctive tense is used in subordinate clauses introduced by certain conjunctions, such as "che" (that), "dubbio che/dubitare che" (doubt that/to doubt that), "non credere che" (not believe that), "non essere certo che" (not be sure that), "non essere sicuro che" (not be certain that), and "non pensare che" (not think that).

For example:

- Sono contento che tu parli italiano. (I'm happy that you speak Italian.)
- Dubbio che loro finiscano i compiti in tempo. (I doubt that they will finish their homework on time.)
- Non credo che lui sia italiano. (I don't believe that he is Italian.)
- Non sono sicura che tu mi ascolti. (I'm not certain that you are listening to me.)

### Desire or Necessity

When expressing desire or necessity, the present subjunctive tense is used in subordinate clauses introduced by certain conjunctions, such as "che" (that), "volere che" (to want that), "desiderare che" (to desire that), "bisogno che" (to need that), and "essere importante che" (to be important that).

For example:

- Voglio che tu mi chiami stasera. (I want you to call me tonight.)
- Desideriamo che voi veniate alla festa. (We desire that you come to the party.)
- È importante che tu studi per l'esame. (It's important that you study for the exam.)
- Ho bisogno che voi mi aiutiate con questa valigia. (I need you to help me with this suitcase.)

### Emotion

When expressing emotion, the present subjunctive tense is used in phrases that express hope, fear, regret, happiness, or sadness.

For example:

- Spero che tu mi capisca. (I hope that you understand me.)
- Mi dispiace che non possiamo venire alla festa. (I regret that we can't come to the party.)
- È triste che loro si siano lasciati. (It's sad that they broke up.)
- Ho paura che non ci sia abbastanza cibo per tutti. (I'm afraid that there won't be enough food for everyone.)
