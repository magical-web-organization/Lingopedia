# Italian Conditional Perfect Tense

The Italian conditional perfect tense (condizionale passato) is used to express a hypothetical situation that would have happened, or would happen, if certain conditions were met in the past or future.

It is formed by combining the conditional of the auxiliary verb 'avere' (to have) or 'essere' (to be) with the past participle of the main verb.

## Formation of the Conditional Perfect Tense

As mentioned above, the conditional perfect tense is formed by combining the conditional of the auxiliary verb 'avere' or 'essere' with the past participle of the main verb.
