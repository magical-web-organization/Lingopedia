The Italian Imperfect Tense, or Imperfetto in Italian, is a verb tense used to talk about past events that are not seen as having an end. Unlike the Italian Preterite Tense that refers to completed past actions, the Imperfect Tense is used to describe a past action or situation that lasted for an extended period or that was habitual. 

### Formation of Italian Imperfect Tense

The regular Imperfect Tense conjugation is relatively simple and follows a regular pattern for all verbs in the Italian language. To form the Imperfect Tense of regular verbs, the verb stem is identified, and the following endings are added:

| Pronoun | -are Verbs | -ere Verbs | -ire Verbs|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Io | -avo | -evo | -ivo |
| Tu | -avi | -evi | -ivi |
| Egli/Ella | -ava | -eva | -iva |
| Noi | -avamo | -evamo | -ivamo |
| Voi | -avate | -evate | -ivate |
| Essi/Esse | -avano | -evano | -ivano |

### Usage of Italian Imperfect Tense

The Italian Imperfect Tense is used in several situations. It is commonly used to describe background information or the setting for a past event, as well as a continuous action in the past. It is also used to express a past habitual action, such as daily routines or repeated events. Here are some examples:

- Continuous action: Mentre camminavo, sentivo la pioggia. (As I walked, I felt the rain.)
- Habitual action: Da bambino, giocavo sempre a calcio. (As a child, I always played soccer.)

The Italian Imperfect Tense is also used to talk about emotions, mental and physical states in the past. It can describe how someone was feeling or what they were thinking at a specific time in the past. Here are some examples:
