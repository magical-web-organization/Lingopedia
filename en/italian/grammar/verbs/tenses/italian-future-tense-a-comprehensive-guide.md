Italian is a beautiful language that is known for its musicality and expressiveness. It is also known for its complex grammar, including the many different tenses that Italian speakers use to express different shades of meaning. One of the most fundamental tenses in Italian is the "futuro semplice," or future tense. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about the Italian future tense, from its formation and irregular verbs to its usage in different contexts.

## Formation of Italian Future Tense

The futuro semplice is formed by adding a set of endings to the infinitive form of the verb. These endings are -ò, -ai, -à, -emo, -ete, and -anno, and they correspond to the different persons and number in Italian. Here is the complete set of endings:

|                               | Singular | Plural  |
|-------------------------------|----------|---------|
| 1st person (io)               | -ò       | -emo   |
| 2nd person (tu)               | -ai       | -ete   |
| 3rd person (lui/lei/Lei)      | -à       | -anno |
| 1st person (noi)              | -emo    |          |
| 2nd person (voi)              | -ete     |          |
| 3rd person (loro)             | -anno   |          |

To form the futuro semplice, you simply take the infinitive form of the verb and add the appropriate ending for the subject. For example:

- Parlare (to speak)
  - Io parlerò (I will speak)
  - Tu parlerai (You will speak)
  - Lui/lei/Lei parlerà (He/she/you formal will speak)

  - Loro parleranno (They will speak)
