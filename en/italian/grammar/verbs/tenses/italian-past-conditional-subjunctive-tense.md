Italian is a beautiful language with a rich history and a wide array of verb tenses. One of the most important verb tenses in Italian is the past conditional subjunctive tense. In this article, we will explore the usage, formation, and examples of the Italian past conditional subjunctive tense.

**Usage**

The past conditional subjunctive is used to express a hypothetical action or event in the past. It is often used in If-clauses or hypothetical situations. For example:

- Se avessi saputo che eri malato, sarei venuto a trovarti. (If I had known you were sick, I would have come to visit you.)

In this example, the past conditional subjunctive is used to express a hypothetical action in the past. The speaker did not know that the other person was sick, but if he had known, he would have come to visit.

**Formation**

The past conditional subjunctive is formed by using the past tense of the auxiliary verb "avere" or "essere" and the past participle of the verb. The main verb is then conjugated in the subjunctive mood. For example:

- Se avessi saputo (if I had known)
- Se fossi andato/a (if I had gone)

Below are the conjugations for the past conditional subjunctive with "avere" and "essere":

|   | Avere  | Essere  |

| io  | avessi avuto  | fossi stato/a |
| tu  | avessi avuto  | fossi stato/a |
| lui/lei/Lei  | avesse avuto  | fosse stato/a |
| noi  | avessimo avuto  | fossimo stati/e |
| voi  | aveste avuto  | foste stati/e |
| loro/Loro  | avessero avuto  | fossero stati/e |
