# German Nouns - Nominative Case

In German grammar, nouns change according to their function in the sentence. One of the primary changes is the declension of nouns in four cases: Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive. Each case denotes a different relationship between the noun and the other words in the sentence.

The Nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, which is the person, thing, or idea that performs the action of the verb. In simple terms, the subject is usually the doer or performer of the action.

## Declension of Nouns in Nominative Case

In the Nominative case, nouns are not changed in their form. The noun remains the same as it appears in the dictionary or the nominative form. However, the article and the adjective that precede the noun can change in the Nominative case for gender, number, and case agreement.

The indefinite article, "ein," changes based on the gender of the noun. For instance, "Einen" is used for masculine nouns; "Eine" is used for feminine nouns, and "Ein" is used for neuter nouns.

Likewise, adjectives regularly change according to gender, number, and adjective agreement. For example, "groß" changes to "große" for feminine singular nouns.

## Examples of Sentences with Nominative case

Here are some examples of simple sentences that use nouns in the nominative case:

- Der Hund läuft. (The dog runs.) - Here "Hund" is the Nominative noun, the subject of the sentence.
- Der Mann isst. (The man eats.) - "Mann" is the Nominative noun, the subject of the sentence.
- Ein Kätzchen schläft. (A kitten sleeps.) - "Kätzchen" is the Nominative noun, the subject of the sentence.

It is crucial to remember that only the subject of the sentence is in the Nominative case; other nouns might appear in other cases depending on their function in the sentence.

## Conclusion

Understanding the Nominative case is crucial for building German sentences correctly. In summary, the Nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence, and nouns in this case do not change their form.

However, the article and the adjective that are used with the noun might change depending on gender, number, and case agreement. By practising sentence building using Nominative case nouns, you can improve your German language skills significantly.
