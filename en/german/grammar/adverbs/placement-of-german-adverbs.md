Adverbs are an essential part of the German language. They can add context, emphasis or modify the meaning of a sentence. However, placing them correctly is crucial for accurate communication. In this article, we'll discuss the placement of German adverbs to achieve the desired effect.

**1. German Adverbs at the beginning of the sentence**

German adverbs often start a sentence. Such a placement attracts attention and emphasis to the intended meaning of the sentence. Here are a few examples:

- Gestern hat er einen neuen Computer gekauft. (Yesterday, he bought a new computer.)
- Leider kann ich heute nicht arbeiten. (Unfortunately, I cannot work today.)
- Immer bestellt sie ihre Kleidung im Internet. (She always orders her clothes online.)

Note that putting an adverb can alter the meaning of the sentence, as in #1. Without the adverb "gestern," the meaning would not change, but adding it tells us that the action happened in the past.

**2. German Adverbs in the middle of the sentence**

Adverbs can also occur in the middle of sentences in the German language. In this position, they change the meaning of the sentence as per the adverb being used. Here are some examples:

- Er arbeitet schnell und gründlich. (He works quickly and thoroughly.)
- Ich komme nicht oft hierher. (I do not come here often.)
- Sie hat trotz ihres Alters ein gutes Gedächtnis. (She has a good memory despite her age.)

In each example, the adverb in the middle creates an impact on the meaning of the sentence. The first example shows both how fast and thoroughly the person works, while the second is straightforward and states that the person does not visit the place much.

**3. German Adverbs at the end of the sentence**

It is also possible to put adverbs at the end of a sentence in German. In this position, the adverb emphasizes the importance of the action or condition of the sentence. Here are some examples:

- Sie sagte es mir immer wieder gern. (She always enjoyed telling me about it repeatedly.)
- Wir werden bald singen. (We will sing soon.)
- Du wirst das Spiel bestimmt gewinnen. (You are sure to win the game.)

In the examples above, the adverbs in the final position show emphasis. The first indicates that the woman continues to feel enthusiastic about telling others repeatedly, the second implies that singing will happen soon, and the final example expresses certainty about the win.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, German adverbs are essential to communicate accurately, and their position can change the meaning and delivery of the sentence. Whether in the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence, adverbs give more detail on the meaning of what we want to express. Paying attention to the placement of adverbs will make your German sentences easier to understand and improve your communication ability.
