Adverbs of frequency are used to indicate how often an action takes place. In German, there are several adverbs of frequency that are commonly used. In this article, we will go over the most common German adverbs of frequency and how to use them in sentences.

## German Adverbs of Frequency

The most commonly used German adverbs of frequency include:

- **immer** - always
- **oft** - often
- **manchmal** - sometimes
- **selten** - rarely
- **nie** - never

Each of these adverbs can be used to describe how often an action takes place. For example:

- *Ich gehe immer ins Fitnessstudio* - I always go to the gym.
- *Er vergisst oft seine Schlüssel* - He often forgets his keys.
- *Sie isst manchmal Sushi zum Mittagessen* - She sometimes eats sushi for lunch.
- *Ich gehe selten ins Kino* - I rarely go to the movies.
- *Sie hat nie Zeit für Freunde* - She never has time for friends.

Notice that in German, the adverb of frequency is typically placed before the verb it modifies.

## Using Adverbs of Frequency in Questions

Adverbs of frequency can also be used in questions, both to ask and to answer. For example:

- *Wie oft gehst du ins Fitnessstudio?* - How often do you go to the gym?
- *Ich gehe zweimal pro Woche.* - I go twice a week.

It is important to note that when answering a question with an adverb of frequency, the adverb typically goes at the beginning of the sentence. For example, instead of saying "Ich gehe zweimal pro Woche," you would say "Zweimal pro Woche gehe ich."

## Using Adverbs of Frequency with Modal Verbs

Adverbs of frequency can also be used with modal verbs, such as *müssen* (must) or *können* (can). For example:

- *Ich muss immer früh aufstehen.* - I always have to wake up early.
- *Sie kann selten ins Kino gehen.* - She rarely can go to the movies.

## Conclusion

German adverbs of frequency are important to know when learning the language. They are used to indicate how often an action takes place and can be used in a variety of sentences, including questions and statements with modal verbs. By incorporating adverbs of frequency into your language learning, you will be able to more effectively communicate in German.
