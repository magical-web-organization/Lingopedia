# German Interrogative Pronouns

In German, interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions. They are similar to the English interrogative pronouns, but they have different forms and uses. There are four main German interrogative pronouns: "wer", "was", "welche(r,s)" and "wann".

## "Wer"

The interrogative pronoun "wer" means "who" in English. It is used to ask about a person or people. It can be used in both singular and plural forms.

### Examples:

- Wer ist das? (Who is that?)
- Wer sind sie? (Who are they?)
- Mit wem hast du gesprochen? (Who did you talk to?)

## "Was"

The interrogative pronoun "was" means "what" in English. It is used to ask about things.

### Examples:

- Was ist das? (What is that?)
- Was hast du gemacht? (What did you do?)
- Was möchtest du essen? (What do you want to eat?)

## "Welche(r,s)"

The interrogative pronoun "welche(r,s)" means "which" in English. It is used to ask about things or people in a selection or group. It has different forms based on the gender and number of the noun it is referring to.

### Examples:

- Welcher Mann ist dein Bruder? (Which man is your brother?)
- Welche Bluse möchtest du kaufen? (Which blouse do you want to buy?)
- Welches Buch hast du gelesen? (Which book did you read?)

## "Wann"

The interrogative pronoun "wann" means "when" in English. It is used to ask about time.

### Examples:

- Wann hast du Geburtstag? (When is your birthday?)
- Wann fängt der Film an? (When does the movie start?)
- Wann kommst du nach Hause? (When are you coming home?)

## Conclusion

German interrogative pronouns are an important part of asking and answering questions. By using "wer", "was", "welche(r,s)" and "wann", you can ask a wide range of questions about people, things, and time. Practice using these pronouns in sentences to improve your German language skills.
