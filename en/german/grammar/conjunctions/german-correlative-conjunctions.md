# German Correlative Conjunctions

In the German language, correlative conjunctions are used to connect words, phrases, and clauses with each other. These conjunctions connect words that are equal in grammatical status, and they always appear in pairs like "both...and", "either...or", and "neither...nor" in English.

## List of German Correlative Conjunctions

Here is a list of German correlative conjunctions along with their English translations:

- sowohl...als auch - both...and
- entweder...oder - either...or
- weder...noch - neither...nor
- nicht nur...sondern auch - not only...but also
- je...desto - the...the
- mal...mal - sometimes...sometimes
- einerseits...andererseits - on the one hand...on the other hand

## How to use German Correlative Conjunctions

To use German correlative conjunctions correctly, you need to keep in mind a few things.

### Word Order

In German, the verb is always the second element in a sentence. When correlative conjunctions are used, the verb is placed immediately following the conjunction, which is usually the first element in the sentence.

Example:

Sowohl Peter als auch seine Schwester gehen ins Kino. - Both Peter and his sister are going to the cinema.

### Agreement of Verb and Subject

When connecting two clauses with correlative conjunctions, it is important to make sure the verb agrees with the subject in both clauses.

Example:

Entweder du gehst in den Park oder ich gehe allein. - Either you go to the park or I go alone.

### Double Negation

When using "weder...noch" in German, double negation is used to express a negative idea.

Example:

Ich habe weder Zeit noch Lust, heute Abend auszugehen. - I have neither the time nor the desire to go out tonight.

## Conclusion

Correlative conjunctions are essential in any language, and in German, they help connect words, phrases, and clauses together to form coherent sentences. By keeping in mind the rules of word order, agreement of verb and subject, and double negation, you can use correlative conjunctions correctly in your German sentences to express your thoughts and ideas clearly.
