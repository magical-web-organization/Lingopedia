# German Adjectives: Accusative Case

Adjectives are an important part of the German language, and they play a crucial role in making language more descriptive and interesting. In German, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. 

One of the cases that adjectives can take in German is the accusative case. The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence, which receives the action of the verb. In German, the accusative case is signaled in the article and the adjective ending.

## Adjective Endings in the Accusative Case 

In the accusative case, the adjective ending changes depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. The following table summarizes the adjective endings in accusative case:

| Masc. | Fem. | Neut. | Plur. |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| -en  | -e   | -es   | -e    |

For example:

- Der __große__ Hund frisst das Fleisch. (The __big__ dog eats the meat.) 
- Ich trinke den __kalten__ Tee. (I am drinking the __cold__ tea.)
- Sie haben das __neue__ Auto gekauft. (They bought the __new__ car.)
- Die __langen__ Schuhe passen mir gut. (The __long__ shoes fit me well.)

In the first example, the adjective "groß" (big) modifies the masculine noun "Hund" (dog) and takes the ending "-en" to show that it is in the accusative case. 

In the second example, the adjective "kalt" (cold) modifies the masculine noun "Tee" (tea) and takes the ending "-en" to show that it is in the accusative case. 

In the third example, the adjective "neu" (new) modifies the neuter noun "Auto" (car) and takes the ending "-es" to show that it is in the accusative case.

In the fourth example, the adjective "lang" (long) modifies the plural noun "Schuhe" (shoes) and takes the ending "-en" to show that it is in the accusative case.

## Adjective Endings with Definite Articles

When using a definite article (der, die, das) in the accusative case, the article itself signals the gender and number of the noun, so the adjective only needs to take the appropriate ending for the accusative case. 

For example: 

- Ich trinke den __kalten__ Tee. (I am drinking the __cold__ tea.)
- Wir besuchen die __alte__ Stadt. (We are visiting the __old__ city.)
- Er liest das __interessante__ Buch. (He is reading the __interesting__ book.)

In these examples, we see that the article indicates the gender and number of the noun and the adjective takes the appropriate ending to indicate the accusative case.

## Adjective Endings with Indefinite Articles

When using an indefinite article (ein, eine), the article takes the ending for the accusative case and the adjective takes the appropriate ending for both the accusative case and the gender of the noun. 

For example:

- Er isst einen __leckeren__ Apfel. (He is eating a __delicious__ apple.) 
- Ich trinke eine __kalte__ Cola. (I am drinking a __cold__ cola.)

In these examples, we see that the article takes the accusative case ending and the adjective takes the appropriate endings for both the accusative case and the gender of the noun.

## Conclusion

Adjectives are a vital part of the German language, and it is important to understand how they change based on the case of the noun they modify. In the accusative case, the adjective endings change depending on the gender and number of the noun. By practicing, you can master the use of adjectives in the accusative case and make your German more descriptive and coherent.
