## Introduction

When learning German, one of the most important aspects to master is the correct usage of adjectives. Apart from that, it is equally important to know when to use them in different cases. Here, we will focus on understanding how to use adjectives in the dative case in German language.

## What is the Dative Case?

The dative case is one of the 4 cases in German language. It is used to indicate the indirect object in a sentence or to show the possession. In simple words, the dative case implies the person or thing that receives the action of the verb. 

For example, in a sentence like "I gave the book to him", "him" is the indirect object and hence is in dative case.

## Dative Case Endings for Adjectives

In order to form adjectives in dative case, we need to attach the appropriate endings. The dative endings for adjectives in German language are -em, -en, and -er. 

The choice of ending depends on the gender of the noun being described, whether it is singular or plural, and if it is preceded by an article or not. 

### Adjectives with Der-Words

If the noun being described is masculine and singular and preceded by the definite article "der", then the adjective takes the ending "-em" in the dative case.

Example:
- Der Mann mit dem roten Auto (The man with the red car).

### Adjectives with Die-Words

If the noun being described is feminine and singular and preceded by the definite article "die", then the adjective takes the ending "-er" in the dative case.

Example:
- Die Frau mit der sch√∂nen Stimme (The woman with the beautiful voice).

### Adjectives with Das-Words

If the noun being described is neuter and singular and preceded by the definite article "das", then the adjective takes the ending "-em" in the dative case.

Example:
- Das Kind mit dem leckeren Eis (The child with the delicious ice cream).

### Adjectives with Plural Nouns

If the noun being described is in the plural form, then the adjective takes the ending "-en" in the dative case irrespective of the gender.

Example:
- Die Leute mit den guten Ideen (The people with the good ideas).
