If you're learning German, you've probably encountered irregular verbs that don't follow the regular conjugation patterns. These verbs are known as "strong verbs," and they are an important part of the German language. In this article, we'll take a closer look at German irregular verbs that belong to the strong verbs category, including their conjugation rules and examples.

## What are Strong Verbs in German?

In German, strong verbs are those that have a vowel change in the stem of the verb in the past tense and/or past participle. For example, the verb "trinken" (to drink) is a strong verb because the vowel changes from "i" to "a" in the past tense ("ich trank") and from "i" to "u" in the past participle ("getrunken").

## Conjugation of Strong Verbs in German

The conjugation of strong verbs in German follows a set of patterns, depending on the vowel change in the stem of the verb. The following are the most common patterns:
