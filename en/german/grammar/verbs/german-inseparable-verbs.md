In German language, there are two types of verbs: separable and inseparable. The separable verbs have a prefix that can be separated from the verb and moved to the end of the clause in which the verb appears. On the other hand, the inseparable verbs have prefixes that cannot be separated from the verb. This article will focus on the German inseparable verbs, their characteristics, and usage.

## Characteristics of German Inseparable Verbs

Inseparable verbs are formed when a prefix is added to the verb stem, and this prefix cannot be separated from the verb during conjugation. The prefixes can be prepositions such as "be-", "ent-", "er-", "ge-", "miss-", "ver-", "zer-", and others. For example, the verb "geben" (to give) has an inseparable prefix "be-", creating a new verb "begab," meaning "to endow."

Inseparable verbs are unique because they have different conjugation forms compared to regular verbs. For instance, the prefix determines the verb’s meaning, but it does not affect the stem of the verb. Therefore, the verb’s conjugation is similar to regular verbs, only the prefix remains attached.

## Usage of German Inseparable Verbs

Inseparable verbs are used in different ways, such as expressing an action, a state, or a direction. Here are some examples of inseparable verbs and their usage:

- **Verlaufen:** This verb means "to run off," "to expire," or "to pass." The prefix "ver-" means "away" or "off," and its presence conveys the idea of something disappearing or ending. For example, "Der Vertrag läuft heute abend aus." (The contract expires tonight).

- **Zerbrechen:** This verb means "to break into pieces." The prefix "zer-" means "apart," indicating that something is being destroyed or coming apart. For example, "Sie zerbrach das Glas." (She broke the glass).

- **Erwachen:** This verb means "to wake up." The prefix "er-" means "out," indicating that someone is coming out of sleep or a daze. For example, "Dieses Morgens erwacht er nicht." (This morning he did not wake up).

## Conclusion

Inseparable verbs are a useful tool for expressing various ideas in German because they allow speakers to convey complex thoughts using a single word. Unlike regular verbs, their prefixes are a crucial component that determines the verb's meaning, but they cannot be detached from the main verb. Therefore, when learning German, it is essential to understand the usage and conjugation of inseparable verbs, as they are an essential aspect of the language.
