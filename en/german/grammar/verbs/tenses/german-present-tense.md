# German Present Tense

The German present tense is the most basic tense that you need to know when starting out. It is used to describe actions and conditions that are occurring at the present moment. It is also used to describe things that are generally true or habitual. In this article, we will go over the basics of the German present tense.

## Conjugation

In German, verbs are conjugated according to the subject. For regular verbs, the present tense is formed by adding the appropriate ending to the stem of the verb.

| Subject | Verb stem  | Ending |
| ------- | --------- | ------ |
| ich     | spiel     | e      |
| du      | spielst   | st     |
| er/sie/es  | spielt   | t      |
| wir     | spielen   | en     |
| ihr     | spielt    | t      |
| sie/Sie  | spielen   | en     |

For example, the verb **spielen** (to play) is conjugated in the present tense as follows:

- ich spiele (I play)
- du spielst (you play)
- er/sie/es spielt (he/she/it plays)
- wir spielen (we play)
- ihr spielt (you all play)
- sie/Sie spielen (they/you play)

## Irregular Verbs

There are certain irregular verbs in German that don't follow the regular conjugation patterns. Some examples of these irregular verbs are:

- **sein** (to be)
- **haben** (to have)
- **werden** (to become)
- **können** (can)
- **mögen** (to like)
- **wissen** (to know)

Here are the conjugations for these verbs in the present tense:

| Verb    | ich      | du      | er/sie/es | wir     | ihr     | sie/Sie |
| ------- | -------- | --------| ---------| --------| ------- | ------- |
| sein    | bin      | bist    | ist      | sind    | seid    | sind    |
| haben   | habe     | hast    | hat      | haben   | habt    | haben   |
| werden  | werde    | wirst   | wird     | werden  | werdet  | werden  |
| können  | kann     | kannst  | kann     | können  | könnt   | können  |
| mögen   | mag      | magst   | mag      | mögen   | mögt    | mögen   |
| wissen  | weiß     | weißt   | weiß     | wissen  | wisst   | wissen  |

## Separable Verbs

One thing that makes German verbs unique is that some verbs are separable. These verbs are made up of two parts, and the prefix can be separated from the main verb. For example, **anfangen** (to begin) is a separable verb. In the present tense, it is conjugated as follows:

- ich fange an (I begin)
- du fängst an (you begin)
- er/sie/es fängt an (he/she/it begins)
- wir fangen an (we begin)
- ihr fangt an (you all begin)
- sie/Sie fangen an (they/you begin)

Notice that in the conjugation, the prefix **an** is separated from the main verb **fangen**.

## In Conclusion

The German present tense is the most basic tense that you need to know when starting out. By learning how to conjugate regular and irregular verbs, as well as separable verbs, you will be able to communicate actions and conditions that are occurring at the present moment.
