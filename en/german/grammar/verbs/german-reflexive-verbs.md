# German Reflexive Verbs 

In German, reflexive verbs are used when the subject of the sentence is also the object. They are formed with a reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject of the sentence.

For example, in an English sentence like "I am washing myself," the reflexive pronoun is "myself." In German, this would be "Ich wasche mich."

## Using Reflexive Verbs 

Reflexive verbs are common in German everyday language and are used for actions that a subject performs on themselves. 

For instance, when you get dressed or brush your teeth, you're doing something to yourself. Other common examples include:

- sich waschen (to wash oneself)
- sich anziehen (to get dressed)
- sich kämmen (to comb one's hair)
- sich hinsetzen (to sit down)

## Forming Reflexive Verbs 

To form a reflexive verb in German, you need to add the appropriate reflexive pronoun to the accusative or dative form of the verb. The reflexive pronoun changes depending on the grammatical case of the sentence.

The reflexive pronouns in German are:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First | mich | uns |
| Second | dich | euch |
| Third | sich | sich |

## Examples 

Here are some examples of reflexive verbs in use:

- Ich wasche mich (I am washing myself)
- Du kämmst dich (You are combing your hair)
- Er setzt sich hin (He is sitting down)
- Wir ziehen uns an (We are getting dressed)
- Ihr ärgert euch (You (plural) are getting angry)
- Sie freut sich (She is happy)

## Separable Verbs 

Reflexive verbs can also be used with separable verbs. In these cases, the reflexive pronoun is placed between the prefix and the rest of the verb. 

For instance, "Ich ziehe mich um" means "I am changing clothes," but "Ich ziehe um" means "I am moving house."

## Conclusion 

Reflexive verbs are an essential part of the German language and are used frequently in everyday conversation. Understanding their concept and how to use them correctly can help you to communicate effectively in German. With regular practice, using reflexive verbs will become second nature.
