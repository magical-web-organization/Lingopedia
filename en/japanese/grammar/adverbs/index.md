# Japanese Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They add information to a sentence, such as how, when, where, or to what extent an action is performed. In Japanese, adverbs are an important part of speech and play a crucial role in conveying the meaning of a sentence.

## Types of Adverbs

### 1. Time Adverbs
Time adverbs indicate when an action takes place. They are usually placed before the verb in a sentence. Some common time adverbs in Japanese are:

* いつ (itsu) - When?
* 今 (ima) - Now
* 昨日 (kinō) - Yesterday
* 今日 (kyō) - Today
* 明日 (ashita) - Tomorrow
* 毎日 (mainichi) - Every day

### 2. Place Adverbs
Place adverbs describe where an action takes place. They are usually placed before the verb in a sentence. Some common place adverbs in Japanese are:

* どこ (doko) - Where?
* ここ (koko) - Here
* そこ (soko) - There
* あそこ (asoko) - Over there
* 中 (naka) - Inside
* 外 (soto) - Outside

### 3. Manner Adverbs
Manner adverbs describe how an action is performed. They are usually placed after the verb in a sentence. Some common manner adverbs in Japanese are:

* ゆっくり (yukkuri) - Slowly

* 全然 (zenzen) - Not at all
* ちょっと (chotto) - Just a bit

## Usage of Adverbs
Adverbs in Japanese are usually placed directly before or after the word they modify. However, there are some rules to follow when using them. Here are some guidelines:

* Time adverbs usually come before the verb.
* Place adverbs usually come before the verb.
* Manner adverbs usually come after the verb.
* Degree adverbs usually come before the verb.

Here are some examples:

* 今日は本当に暑いですね。 (Kyō wa hontō ni atsui desu ne.) - Today is really hot, isn't it?
* 私はいつも毎日朝ご飯を食べます。 (Watashi wa itsumo mainichi asa gohan o tabemasu.) - I always eat breakfast every day.
* プールで上手に泳げるようになりたいです。 (Pūru de jōzu ni oyogeru yō ni naritai desu.) - I want to become better at swimming in the pool.
* 彼女はとても綺麗な服を着ています。 (Kanojo wa totemo kirei na fuku o kiteimasu.) - She is wearing a very beautiful dress.
