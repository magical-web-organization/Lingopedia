# Japanese Coordinating Conjunctions

Conjunctions are an important part of any language's grammar. These are words that connect different parts of a sentence or different sentences to create a clear and coherent thought. In Japanese, coordinating conjunctions are used to join words, phrases, and independent clauses.

Here are some commonly used Japanese coordinating conjunctions and their meanings:

## 1. そして (soshite)

This conjunction means "and" in Japanese. It is used to connect two similar, independent clauses.

Example: 私はアメリカに行きました。そして、イギリスにも行きました。
(Watashi wa Amerika ni ikimashita. Soshite, Igirisu ni mo ikimashita.) 
"I went to America. And, I also went to England."

## 2. または (matawa)

This means "or" in Japanese, and it is used to connect two choices.

Example: 私は映画を見るだろう。それとも、本を読むだろう。(Watashi wa eiga wo miru darou. Sore tomo, hon wo yomu darou.)
"I will either watch a movie or read a book."

## 3. しかし (shikashi)

This conjunction means "however" in Japanese. It is used to indicate a contrast between two clauses.

Example: 今日は寒いです。しかし、明日は暖かいです。(Kyou wa samui desu. Shikashi, ashita wa atatakai desu.)
"It is cold today. However, it will be warm tomorrow."

## 4. だから (dakara)

This conjunction means "so" or "therefore" in Japanese. It indicates a reason or cause and effect.

Example: 今日は運動をしたから疲れた。(Kyou wa undou wo shita kara tsukareta.)
"I am tired today because I exercised."

## 5. また (mata)

This conjunction means "also" or "in addition" in Japanese. It is used to connect two similar clauses.

Example: 私はピアノが弾けます。また、ギターも弾けます。(Watashi wa piano ga hikemasu. Mata, gitaa mo hikemasu.)
"I can play the piano. Also, I can play the guitar."

## 6. そしてまた (soshite mata)

This conjunction means "and also" in Japanese. It is used to connect two similar clauses in a stronger sense than "そして" or "また".

Example: 彼は仕事ができます。そしてまた、スポーツが得意です。(Kare wa shigoto ga dekimasu. Soshite mata, supootsu ga tokui desu.)
"He is good at work. And also, he is good at sports."

## 7. つまり (tsumari)

This conjunction means "in other words" in Japanese. It is used to explain or summarize the previous sentence.

Example: 彼女は忙しいです。つまり、会えません。(Kanojo wa isogashii desu. Tsumari, aemasen.)
"She is busy. In other words, I cannot meet her."

Japanese coordinating conjunctions are relatively easy to use once you get the hang of them. To choose the appropriate conjunction, you need to understand the context of the sentence and the relationship between the clauses. With practice, you can become confident in using these conjunctions to create clear and effective sentences in Japanese.
