# Japanese Subordinating Conjunctions

In Japanese language, there are many ways to connect one clause to another. Subordinating conjunctions are one of those ways, which connect a subordinate clause to the main clause. Subordinate conjunctions are called "fukushi" in Japanese. Let's take a look at some common Japanese subordinating conjunctions and how they are used.

### 1. kara - because

"Kara" is a common subordinating conjunction that means "because". It is used to connect the cause of an event to the event itself. For example:

```
Watashi wa kare ni denwa shita, kara shiriai mashita.
(I called him and got to know him)
```

In this sentence, "kara" connects the reason for calling him to the result, which is getting to know him. 

### 2. node - so, therefore

"Node" is used to connect a conclusion drawn from a previous statement, similar to "so" or "therefore". For example:

```
Kanpai shita node, watakushi wa sake wo nomimashita.
(I raised a toast, so I drank sake)
```

Here, "node" connects the reason for drinking sake to raising a toast.

### 3. to - when, if

"To" is a subordinating conjunction used to express conditions or situations. It can mean "when" or "if". For example:

```
Ame ga futte kita to, watashitachi wa kasa wo motte ikimashita.
(When it started to rain, we went out with an umbrella)
```

In this sentence, "to" connects the condition of rain to the action of going out with an umbrella. 

### 4. ga - although, despite

"Ga" is used to show contrast between two clauses, similar to "although" or "despite". For example:

```
Atarashii keitai wo katta ga, mada tsukaimasu.
(I bought a new phone, although I'm still using the old one)
```

"Ga" connects the two clauses that express contrast.

### 5. te - while, and

"Te" can have multiple meanings depending on context, but it is commonly used to mean "while" or "and". For example:

```
Wakai toki ni Nihon ni ikite ita te, tsurutsuru ni nari mashita.
(While I was living in Japan when I was young, I became fluent)
```

In this sentence, "te" connects the two clauses that happen at the same time.

### 6. ba - if, when

"Ba" is used to express a hypothetical or conditional situation, similar to "if" or "when". For example:

```
Nihon ni ikereba, Fuji-san ni nobori taku naru ba.
(If you go to Japan, you should climb Mount Fuji)
```

"Ba" connects the condition of going to Japan to the hypothetical situation of climbing Mount Fuji.

### 7. no ni - even though

"No ni" is used to express a situation that is unexpected or contrary to what is expected. For example:

```
Kuruma wo kawanakatta no ni, kaimono ni iki mashita.
(Even though I didn't buy a car, I went shopping)
```

In this sentence, "no ni" connects the unexpected situation of not buying a car to the action of going shopping.
