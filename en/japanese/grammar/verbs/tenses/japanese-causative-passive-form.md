The Japanese language is known for its intricate grammar structures and forms, and one of these is the causative-passive form. This form combines both the passive and the causative forms to express how someone or something is made to do or have something done to them. In this article, we will delve deeper into the Japanese causative-passive form and its usage.

## What is the Causative-Passive Form?

The causative-passive form in Japanese is a compound verb form that allows the speaker to convey how an action is both caused and received. This form is created by combining the causative form with the passive form of the verb. The causative form expresses the idea of making or causing something to happen while the passive form expresses the idea of receiving or being affected by something.

## How is the Causative-Passive Form Constructed?

To create the causative-passive form, we first need to have the verb stem. The verb stem is obtained by removing the ~u~ ending from the dictionary form of the verb. Once we have the verb stem, we can then create the causative form by adding ~せる~ for group 1 verbs (verbs that end in -る) or ~させる~ for group 2 verbs (verbs that end in -る, -つ, -う, -ぶ, and -む).

Next, we add the passive form by adding ~られる~ for group 1 verbs or ~られる~ for group 2 verbs. Finally, we combine the two forms by adding ~させられる~ for group 1 verbs or ~させられる~ for group 2 verbs.

Here is an example using the verb 食べる (taberu) which means "to eat":

Causative form: 食べさせる (tabesaseru)

Passive form: 食べられる (taberareru)

Causative-passive form: 食べさせられる (tabesaserareru)

## How is the Causative-Passive Form Used?

The Japanese causative-passive form is often used to describe situations where someone is made to do something against their will or is in a passive state of having something done to them. It can also be used to describe situations that are out of the speaker's control.

Here are some examples of the causative-passive form in use:

1. 私はそんなことを言わせられた。(Watashi wa sonna koto wo iwasarerata) - "I was made to say such a thing."
2. 友達にお金を貸させられた。(Tomodachi ni okane wo kasaserareta) - "I was made to lend money to my friend."
3. 転勤させられた。(Tenkin saserareta) - "I was transferred to another location (against my will)."

In addition to the above, the causative-passive form can also be used to express how someone was influenced or persuaded to do something.

4. 母に説得させられて、留学することになった。(Haha ni settoku saserarete, ryugaku suru koto ni natta) - "I was persuaded by my mother to study abroad."

## Conclusion

The Japanese causative-passive form is a unique and versatile grammar structure that is commonly used in everyday Japanese. By combining the causative and passive forms, speakers are able to convey a wide range of ideas and nuances in their language. Understanding how to create and use the causative-passive form is essential for anyone looking to improve their mastery of the Japanese language.
