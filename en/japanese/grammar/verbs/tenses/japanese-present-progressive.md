Japanese language learners often find the present progressive tense difficult to grasp. It is also known as the present continuous tense, and it indicates an action that is currently taking place or is in progress. In this article, we will explore the usage of the Japanese present progressive tense and how it can be used in daily conversations.

## Formation

In Japanese, the present progressive tense is formed by combining the verb stem with the verb いる (iru). The verb stem is the part of the verb that comes before the last syllable. For example, the verb stem of the word 食べる (taberu) means "to eat" is 食べ (tabe).

The present progressive tense of 食べる (taberu) would be 食べている (tabete iru), which means "to be eating." Note that the verb いる (iru) is conjugated to agree with the subject, as shown in the examples below.

- 私は朝ごはんを食べています。
  (Watashi wa asa gohan o tabete imasu.)
  I am eating breakfast.
- 彼女は今本を読んでいます。
  (Kanojo wa ima hon o yonde imasu.)
  She is reading a book right now.

## Usage

The Japanese present progressive tense is used to describe an ongoing action or state, similar to its English counterpart. It is often used in situations where we want to express what we are doing at the moment or to inquire about what someone else is doing.

### 1. Ongoing actions

  What are you doing right now?
- 私は家族と遊んでいます。
  (Watashi wa kazoku to asonde imasu.)
  I am playing with my family.

### 2. Temporary states

The present progressive tense can also be used to describe temporary states, such as feelings or physical sensations. For example:

- 彼は疲れている。
  (Kare wa tsukarete iru.)
  He is tired.
- 私は寒いです。
  (Watashi wa samui desu.)
  I am cold.

### 3. Future plans

In Japanese, the present progressive tense can be used to describe future plans that have already been decided. For example:

- 明日は友達と映画を見ています。
  (Ashita wa tomodachi to eiga o mite imasu.)
  Tomorrow, I am watching a movie with friends.
- 土曜日には日本語のクラスに行っています。
  (Doyoubi ni wa Nihongo no kurasu ni itte imasu.)
