In the Japanese language, there are several ways to express the passive voice. The passive voice is used when the subject of the sentence is not the doer of the action, but rather the receiver of the action. The Japanese Passive Form is one of the many ways the passive voice can be expressed in the language. 

In this article, we will discuss the Japanese Passive Form, how it functions, and its use in communication.

## What is the Japanese Passive Form?

The Japanese Passive Form is a grammatical structure used to express the passive voice in Japanese. The passive voice is typically used to emphasize the receiver of an action in a sentence, rather than the doer. 

In Japanese, the Passive Form is created by using the auxiliary verb 「られる」(rareru) or 「れる」(reru) after the stem of a verb. The choice of which one to use depends on the verb's last syllable. 

For example, the verb 「話す」(hanasu) means "to speak". Its stem is 「話し」(hanashi). To form the Passive Form, you would remove the final 「す」(su) sound and add 「られる」(rareru) to get 「話される」(hanasareru), meaning "to be spoken".

Here are some additional examples of how the Passive Form is created in Japanese:

- 食べる (taberu) to eat → 食べられる (taberareru) to be eaten
- 書く (kaku) to write → 書かれる (kakareru) to be written
- 聞く (kiku) to listen → 聞かれる (kikareru) to be listened to

## How does the Japanese Passive Form function?

The Passive Form is used to emphasize the receiver of an action in a sentence. It can be used to talk about something that happened to someone or something, or to indicate that someone or something was affected by an action without specifying who or what did it.

For example, consider the following sentence:

- 私はパンを食べた (watashi wa pan o tabeta) - I ate bread.

When we use the Passive Form, we change the focus of the sentence to emphasize the bread, the receiver of the action. 

- パンは食べられた (pan wa taberareta) - The bread was eaten.

In the Passive Form, we can also add the particle 「に」(ni) to indicate who or what performed the action. For example:

- 先生に褒められた (sensei ni homerareta) - I was praised by the teacher.

Here, we use the particle 「に」(ni) to show that the teacher was the one who did the praising.

## How is the Japanese Passive Form used in communication?

The Japanese Passive Form is used in a variety of situations in communication. It is often used to shift the focus of a sentence and emphasize the receiver of an action. It can also be used to talk about actions without specifying who did them.

Here are some examples of how the Passive Form is used in communication:

- To describe accidents or unpleasant events: 「車がぶつかったら、背中を痛められた」(Kuruma ga butsukattara, senaka o itamerareta) - When the car hit me, my back was injured.
- To describe situations where a person is affected by someone else's actions: 「話を聞かれているだけです」(Hana o kikareteiru dake desu) - I'm just being listened to.
- To describe situations where the doer of the action is unknown: 「この荷物は誰かに取られたみたいだ」(Kono nimotsu wa dareka ni toraretamitai da) - It looks like someone took this package.

## Conclusion

The Passive Form is an important grammatical structure in the Japanese language that allows the speaker to express themselves in a more nuanced way. By emphasizing the receiver of an action, it can shift the focus of a sentence and convey information about what happened without specifying who did it. By understanding how the Passive Form works, learners of Japanese can communicate more effectively and naturally in a variety of situations.
