In Japanese culture, there is a unique communication style known as the Positive Imperative. It is often used to convey positivity, politeness, and respect in various situations, both personal and professional. Understanding the Positive Imperative is essential for anyone visiting or doing business in Japan as it can help you navigate social situations with ease and build better relationships with clients or colleagues.

## What is the Japanese Positive Imperative?

The Japanese Positive Imperative is a way of expressing requests, suggestions, and commands in a positive and polite manner. It is based on the belief that using positive language helps to build stronger relationships and creates a sense of harmony between people. In contrast to Western culture, where direct and assertive communication is often valued, the Positive Imperative emphasizes indirectness, subtlety, and harmony.

## Why is it important?

Using the Positive Imperative is a sign of respect and consideration for the other person. It helps to avoid any potential conflict or offense that might arise from more direct and assertive language. It's particularly useful in situations where you need to establish a rapport with someone or when dealing with someone of higher status in society. Using indirect and respectful language can help establish trust and create a more harmonious environment for communication.

## Examples of the Positive Imperative in Japanese

Here are some examples of how the Positive Imperative is used in Japanese:

- Instead of saying "Do this," you would say "It would be great if you could do this."
- Instead of saying "Don't do that," you would say "It might be better if you didn't do that."
- Instead of saying "I need you to do this," you would say "I would appreciate it if you could do this for me."

By using language that emphasizes respect and politeness, Japanese speakers can communicate their requests more effectively while also maintaining a sense of harmony and cooperation.

## How to use the Positive Imperative

To use the Positive Imperative in your own communication style, pay attention to the tone and language you use when making requests, suggestions, or commands. You should aim to be polite and subtle, focusing on building rapport and creating a positive atmosphere for conversation. Some tips for using the Positive Imperative include:

- Using indirect language, such as "It would be great if" or "I would appreciate it if."
- Softening your requests by using "please" and "thank you."
- Avoiding negative language or criticism, as it can be perceived as confrontational or rude.

While using the Positive Imperative takes some getting used to, it can be an effective way to build relationships, establish trust and communicate more effectively in Japanese culture.

## Conclusion

The Japanese Positive Imperative is a unique communication style that emphasizes positivity, politeness, and respect. By learning about and using this style, you can build stronger relationships, avoid potential conflict and establish trust in personal and professional settings. So take the time to learn more about this communication style and incorporate it into your own language skills when communicating with Japanese people — it may make all the difference in building successful relationships in Japan.
