# Japanese Future Tense

In the Japanese language, there are two different ways to express the future tense: the "present tense future" and the "non-past tense future."

## Present Tense Future

The present tense future is used to express actions that will occur in the future, but it is formed using the present tense of verbs.

For example:

- 明日、映画を見に行く。(Ashita, eiga wo mi ni iku.) - "Tomorrow, I will go to see a movie."

In this sentence, the verb "iku" (to go) is in the present tense form "iku" and is used to express a future action.

## Non-Past Tense Future

The non-past tense future is formed by using the non-past form of verbs. It is used to express actions that will occur in the future as well as actions that will be repeated in the future.

For example:

- 来年、日本に行く。(Rainen, Nihon ni iku.) - "Next year, I will go to Japan."

In this sentence, the verb "iku" (to go) is in the non-past form "iku" and is used to express a future action.

## Differences from Present Tense and Past Tense

The Japanese future tense differs from the present tense and past tense in the following ways:

- The present tense future is formed using the present tense of verbs, while the non-past tense future is formed using the non-past form of verbs.
- The present tense future is used to express actions that will occur in the future, while the non-past tense future is used to express actions that will occur in the future as well as actions that will be repeated in the future.
- The past tense is used to express completed actions in the past, while the Japanese future tense is used to express actions that will occur in the future.

## Conclusion

Knowing how to use the Japanese future tense is important for communicating about future events and plans. By understanding the differences between the present tense future and non-past tense future, you can use the appropriate form to express your intended meaning.
