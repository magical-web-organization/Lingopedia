Japanese verbs have several different tenses that are used to denote the timing of an action, along with its completion or continuation. This guide will cover all Japanese verb tenses and their usage, along with example sentences.

## Infinitive Form (Dictionary Form)

The infinitive form, also known as the dictionary form, is the base form of a Japanese verb. It is used to look up verbs in Japanese dictionaries, and is also used in various other contexts, such as giving commands and making requests. 

Example:  食べる (taberu) - to eat

## Present Tense

The present tense in Japanese is used to describe actions that are currently happening or habitual actions. 

Example: 今、食べている (ima, tabeteiru) - I am currently eating.

## Past Tense

The past tense in Japanese is used to describe actions that have already happened. 

Example: 昨日、食べた (kinou, tabeta) - I ate yesterday.

## Future Tense

The future tense in Japanese is used to describe actions that will happen in the future. 

Example: 明日、食べる (ashita, taberu) - I will eat tomorrow.

## Present Progressive (ている)

The present progressive, also known as the present continuous, is used to describe actions in progress or actions that have been completed but are still relevant. 

Example: ゆうべ、ジムに行っていた (yuube, jimuni itteita) - I was going to the gym last night.

## Past Progressive (ていた)

The past progressive is used to describe actions that were in progress at a certain point in the past. 

Example: 昨日、シャワーを浴びていた (kinou, shawaa o abiteita) - I was taking a shower yesterday.

## Positive Imperative (て form)

The positive imperative, also known as the command form, is used to give orders or directions. 

Example: 食べてください (tabete kudasai) - Please eat.

## Negative Imperative (ないで form)

The negative imperative is used to give negative orders or directions. 

Example: 食べないでください (tabenai de kudasai) - Please don't eat.

## Potential Form (られる)

The potential form is used to express possibility or ability. 

Example: 話せる (hanaseru) - I can speak (language).

## Passive Form (られる)

The passive form in Japanese is used to express that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon by another agent. 

Example: このパンは美味しくないと思われる (kono pan wa oishikunai to omowareru) - This bread is thought to not be delicious.

## Causative form (させる／せる)

The causative form in Japanese is used to indicate that something is being caused to happen by the subject. 

Example: アンドリューは韓国語を勉強させてくれる (andoryuu wa kankokugo o benkyou sasete kureru) - Andrew teaches me Korean.

## Causative-passive Form (させられる／せられる)

The causative-passive form in Japanese is used to indicate that someone is both causing something to happen and being acted upon by another agent. 

Example: 風邪を引かせられる (kaze o hikaserareru) - I was made to catch a cold.

In conclusion, understanding the various Japanese verb tenses is crucial to communicating effectively in Japanese. Mastering these tenses will take time and practice, but with dedication and persistence, anyone can improve their skills in Japanese.
