When learning a new language, the present tense is often one of the first verb tenses that students encounter. In Japanese, the present tense (現在形 genzaikei) is no exception. In this guide, we will explore the formation and usage of the Japanese present tense, along with some special cases and common mistakes that learners might encounter.

## Formation

To form the present tense in Japanese, we need to conjugate verbs by removing the final -ru and adding the appropriate ending depending on the verb group. There are three verb groups in Japanese: the ~u group, the ~iru and ~eru group, and the irregular group.

### ~u group

Verbs that belong to the ~u group end in ~u in their dictionary (or plain) form. To form the present tense, we simply remove the final ~u and add ~imasu if we want to use the polite form, or ~u if we want to use the plain form. For example:

- 食べる (taberu) -> 食べます (tabemasu) (polite) / 食べる (taberu) (plain)
- 見る (miru) -> 見ます (mimasu) (polite) / 見る (miru) (plain)
- 行く (iku) -> 行きます (ikimasu) (polite) / 行く (iku) (plain)

Note that some verbs in the ~u group might have irregularities in their stem when conjugated. For example, 来る (kuru) becomes 来ます (kimasu) in the polite form instead of the expected *来ります (korimasu).

### ~iru and ~eru group

Verbs that belong to the ~iru and ~eru group end in ~iru and ~eru respectively in their dictionary form. To form the present tense, we simply remove the final ~ru and add ~imasu if we want to use the polite form, or ~u if we want to use the plain form. For example:

- 食べる (taberu) -> 食べます (tabemasu) (polite) / 食べる (taberu) (plain)
- 見る (miru) -> 見ます (mimasu) (polite) / 見る (miru) (plain)
- 起きる (okiru) -> 起きます (okimasu) (polite) / 起きる (okiru) (plain)
- 遊ぶ (asobu) -> 遊びます (asobimasu) (polite) / 遊ぶ (asobu) (plain)

Note that there is no clear rule for differentiating between verbs that belong to the ~iru and ~eru group. Some verbs might end in both ~iru and ~eru (e.g. よろしく / よろしい) or neither (e.g. 来る / する).

### Irregular group

Verbs that belong to the irregular group have their own unique way of conjugation in the present tense. Some common examples include:

- する (suru) -> します (shimasu) (polite) / する (suru) (plain)
- 来る (kuru) -> 来ます (kimasu) (polite) / 来る (kuru) (plain)
- ある (aru) -> あります (arimasu) (polite) / ある (aru) (plain)

## Usage

In Japanese, the present tense is used in a variety of situations, including:

### Stative verbs

Stative verbs refer to a state or condition, rather than an action or event. Some examples of stative verbs in Japanese include:

- ある (aru) - to exist
- いる (iru) - to be (animate)
- なる (naru) - to become
- あきらめる (akirameru) - to give up
- かかる (kakaru) - to take (time/money)

### Habitual actions

The present tense can also be used to describe habitual or repeated actions. For example:

- 毎日テレビを見ます。 (Mainichi terebi o mimasu.) - I watch TV every day.
- いつもここでコーヒーを飲みます。 (Itsumo koko de kōhī o nomimasu.) - I always drink coffee here.

### General truths

The present tense can be used to express general truths or facts that are always true, regardless of time or situation. For example:

- 水は湿ります。 (Mizu wa shimerimasu.) - Water becomes wet.
- 日本語は難しいです。 (Nihongo wa muzukashii desu.) - Japanese is difficult.

### Immediate actions

Finally, the present tense can be used to describe immediate or ongoing actions. For example:

- 今、何をしていますか？ (Ima, nani o shite imasu ka?) - What are you doing right now?
- ちょっと待ってください。 (Chotto matte kudasai.) - Please wait a moment.

## Special cases and common mistakes

Despite its relatively straightforward conjugation, the Japanese present tense does have some special cases and common mistakes that learners might encounter. Here are some examples:

### する and くる

As mentioned earlier, する (suru) and くる (kuru) are irregular verbs that have their own unique way of conjugation in the present tense. It's important to memorize these verbs separately, as their present tense forms cannot be deduced from their dictionary forms.

### ~iru and ~eru verbs in the negative form

In the negative form of ~iru and ~eru verbs, we add ~nai instead of ~imasen for the polite form, and ~anai instead of ~u for the plain form. For example:

- 食べません (tabemasen) (polite) / 食べない (tabenai) (plain)
- 見ません (mimasen) (polite) / 見ない (minai) (plain)

### いる and ある in the negative form

In the negative form, いる (to be, animate) becomes いない and ある (to exist) becomes ない. For example:

- 犬がいないです。 (Inu ga inai desu.) - There is no dog.
- 私はいないです。 (Watashi wa inai desu.) - I am not here.

### Common mistakes

Some common mistakes that learners might make when using the present tense include:

- Mixing up the polite and plain forms. Remember that the polite form ends in ~imasu and the plain form ends in ~u (except for some irregular verbs).
- Forgetting to conjugate verbs. In Japanese, conjugation is essential for expressing different tenses and moods. Make sure to practice conjugating different verbs and paying attention to their specific groups and irregularities.
- Translating too literally. Japanese sentence structure can be quite different from English, so it's important to focus on meaning rather than word-for-word translation.

## Conclusion

The Japanese present tense may seem relatively simple at first glance, but as we have seen in this guide, there are many nuances and special cases to consider. With practice and attention to detail, however, learners can master the present tense and begin to engage in a variety of conversations and situations with ease.
