# Japanese Potential Form

In Japanese grammar, the potential form, also known as 可能形 (kanoukei) in Japanese, is a verb conjugation used to indicate the ability or possibility to do something. It is formed by adding the suffix られる (rareru) to the stem of a verb.

## Formation

Here are the steps to form the Japanese potential form:

1. Take the stem of the verb (for ichidan verbs, simply remove the last -ru character; for godan verbs, change the last vowel sound to -e)
2. Add the suffix られる to the verb stem

For example:

- 食べる taberu (to eat) -> 食べられる taberareru (able to eat)
- 見る miru (to see) -> 見られる mirareru (able to see)
- 遊ぶ asobu (to play) -> 遊べる asoberu (able to play)

## Usage

1. Potential Action

The potential form is used to indicate the ability to perform a certain action. For example:

- 漢字(かんじ)が読(よ)めますか? Kanji ga yomemasu ka? (Can you read Kanji?)
- 叔父(おじ)は英語(えいご)が話(はな)せます。Oji wa eigo ga hanasemasu. (My uncle can speak English.)

2. Suggestion/Request

The potential form is also used to make polite suggestions and requests. For example:

- 私(わたし)たちは今(いま)から映画(えいが)が見(み)れますか。Watashitachi wa ima kara eiga ga miremasu ka? (Can we watch a movie from now on?)
- 来年(らいねん)パリを訪(おとず)れますか。Rainen Pari wo otozuremasu ka? (Could you visit Paris next year?)

3. Possibility

Finally, the potential form is used in making statements about what is possible or not. For example:

- あの騒(さわ)ぎは何(なに)が起(お)きても不思議(ふしぎ)ではありません。Ano sawagi wa nani ga okite mo fushigi de wa arimasen. (It’s not surprising that there was commotion, no matter what happened.)
- 私(わたし)たちは明日(あした)億(おく)円(えん)が当(あ)たる可能(かのう)性(せい)がある。Watashitachi wa ashita oku en ga ataru kanousei ga aru. (We have the possibility of winning a billion yen tomorrow.)
