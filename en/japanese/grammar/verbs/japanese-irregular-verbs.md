# Japanese Irregular Verbs

Like any other language, the Japanese language has its set of irregular verbs. Irregular verbs are verbs that do not follow the typical conjugation rules of the Japanese language. The Japanese language has two types of irregular verbs: godan verbs and ichidan verbs.

## Godan Verbs

Godan verbs are also known as **"u-verbs"** or Group 1 verbs. They are named so because their final sound is usually "u". They are called irregular verbs because they do not follow the typical conjugation rules of Group 1 verbs.

To conjugate a regular Group 1 verb, you simply drop the "u" at the end and add the appropriate ending. However, with Godan verbs, it is not that simple. Below are some examples of Godan verbs and their conjugation:

- 遊ぶ (asobu) - to play: 
    - Present tense: 遊ぶ (asobu)
    - Past tense: 遊んだ (asonda)
    - Te-form: 遊んで (asonde)
    - Negative tense: 遊ばない (asobanai)
- 話す (hanasu) - to speak: 
    - Present tense: 話す (hanasu)
    - Past tense: 話した (hanashita)
    - Te-form: 話して (hanashite)
    - Negative tense: 話さない (hanasanai)

As you can see, the conjugation of Godan verbs changes in the past tense and negative tense. Instead of simply dropping the "u" at the end, you must replace it with the appropriate character.

## Ichidan Verbs

Ichidan verbs are also called **"ru-verbs"** or Group 2 verbs. They are called irregular verbs because they do not follow the typical conjugation rules of Group 2 verbs. To conjugate a regular Group 2 verb, you simply remove the "ru" at the end and add the appropriate ending.

Below are some examples of Ichidan verbs and their conjugation:

- 食べる (taberu) - to eat:
    - Present tense: 食べる (taberu)
    - Past tense: 食べた (tabeta)
    - Te-form: 食べて (tabete)
    - Negative tense: 食べない (tabenai)
- 生きる (ikiru) - to live: 
    - Present tense: 生きる (ikiru)
    - Past tense: 生きた (ikita)
    - Te-form: 生きて (ikite)
    - Negative tense: 生きない (ikinai)

As you can see, the conjugation of Ichidan verbs changes in the past tense. Instead of simply removing the "ru" at the end, you must replace it with the appropriate character.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Japanese language has its set of irregular verbs that do not follow the typical conjugation rules of Group 1 and Group 2 verbs. It is important to understand how to conjugate these irregular verbs as they are commonly used in everyday Japanese conversation. With regular practice and exposure, conjugating these irregular verbs will become more natural and effortless.
