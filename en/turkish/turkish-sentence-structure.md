Turkish is an agglutinative language with a flexible sentence structure. This means that words in a sentence are formed by adding suffixes to a stem word, rather than being conveyed by separate words. Understanding the structure of a Turkish sentence is key to forming grammatically correct sentences.

## Word Order

In Turkish, word order is more flexible than it is in English. The basic word order of a Turkish sentence is subject-object-verb (SOV). For example, "Ben elma yerim" translates to "I eat apples". However, it is also possible to use object-subject-verb (OSV) or object-verb-subject (OVS) word order for emphasis or to change the emphasis in a sentence. 

## Verb Conjugation

In Turkish, verb conjugation does not change based on the subject of the sentence. Instead, verb suffixes indicate the tense, mood, and aspect of the verb. 

For example, the present simple tense suffix is "-yor", which is added to the root of the verb. For example, "yürü-yor-um" means "I am walking". The past tense suffix is "-di", which is added to the root of the verb. For example, "yürü-dü-m" means "I walked".

## Sentence Types

There are three main types of sentences in Turkish: declarative, interrogative, and imperative.

Declarative sentences make a statement, and typically end with a period. For example, "Ben bir öğretmenim" means "I am a teacher".

Interrogative sentences ask a question, and typically end with a question mark. For example, "Nerede oturuyorsun?" means "Where do you live?"

Imperative sentences give a command or request, and typically end with an exclamation point. For example, "Gel buraya!" means "Come here!"

## Conclusion

Understanding Turkish sentence structure is essential for effective communication in the language. Though the language is an agglutinative one, its flexible sentence structure still allows for fluid communication between speakers. Learning the nuances of word orders, verb conjugation, and sentence types will make it easier to produce grammatically correct, natural sounding Turkish.
