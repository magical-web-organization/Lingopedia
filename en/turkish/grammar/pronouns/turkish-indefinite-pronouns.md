Indefinite pronouns, as the name suggests, are pronouns that do not refer to a specific person, place, thing, or idea. They are used in sentences where the referent is not known, identified, or specified.

In the Turkish language, indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the suffix "-ki" to the interrogative pronouns. The most common indefinite pronouns in Turkish are:

- Kimse: Anyone/No one
- Herkes: Everyone
- Bir şey: Something/Anything
- Hiçbir şey: Nothing

Let's see how these indefinite pronouns are used in sentences:

- Kimse gelmedi. (No one came.)
- Herkes burada. (Everyone is here.)
- Bir şey söylemek istemiyorum. (I don't want to say anything.)
- Hiçbir şey olmaz. (Nothing will happen.)

Notice that the suffix "-ki" is added to the interrogative pronouns "kim" (who), "her" (every), "ne" (what), and "hiç" (none). Indefinite pronouns are not inflected for case or number, and they are usually used as the subject or object of a sentence.

Other common indefinite pronouns in Turkish are:

- Başka bir şey: Another thing, something else
- Hepsi: All
- Bazıları: Some
- Herhangi bir şey: Anything, something

Let's see some examples of how they are used:

- Başka bir şey istiyor musun? (Do you want something else?)
- Hepsi senin hatan. (It's all your fault.)
- Bazıları indirimli. (Some are on sale.)
- Herhangi bir şey seçebilirsin. (You can choose anything.)

In addition to these indefinite pronouns, Turkish also has negative indefinite pronouns that express a negation or absence of something:

- Hiç kimse: No one
- Hiçbir yer: Nowhere
- Hiçbir zaman: Never

Here are some examples of how they are used:

- Hiç kimse konuşmuyor. (No one is speaking.)
- Hiçbir yerde olmak istemiyorum. (I don't want to be anywhere.)
- Hiçbir zaman yapamayacağım. (I will never be able to do it.)

In conclusion, indefinite pronouns are an important part of Turkish grammar and are used to refer to non-specific or unknown referents. By adding the suffix "-ki" to interrogative pronouns, we can form a wide range of indefinite pronouns in Turkish.
