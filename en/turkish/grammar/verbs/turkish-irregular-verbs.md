Turkish has a vast vocabulary of verbs, including irregular verbs. Irregular verbs in Turkish language have exceptions from the regular verb patterns of suffixing. Irregular verbs can be confusing for beginners, so let's explore the Turkish irregular verbs and learn how to use them.

## What are irregular verbs in Turkish?

Irregular verbs in Turkish are the verbs that do not follow the standard pattern of verb suffixes. For example, the usual verb pattern is "-mek" or "-mak." However, with irregular verbs, the rules change, and they add different suffixes or change their stems.

## Types of Irregular Verbs in Turkish

There are three types of irregular verbs in Turkish, as follows:

### 1. Stem-changing verbs

Stem-changing verbs are the verbs that change their stem when conjugated. Some of the stem-changing irregular verbs in Turkish include:

* gitmek (to go) - changes to "gidiyor," instead of "gidiyorum" or "gidiyorsun."
* bulmak (to find) - changes to "bulur," instead of "bulurum" or "bulursun."

### 2. Dissimilar verbs

Dissimilar irregular verbs are the verbs that completely change when conjugated. They neither follow the standard "mek/mak" rule nor the stem-changing rule. Some examples of dissimilar verbs are:

* vermek (to give) - changes to "verir," instead of "veririm" or "verirsin."
* görmek (to see) - changes to "görür," instead of "görürüm" or "görürsün."

### 3. Phonetically irregular verbs

Phonetically irregular verbs are the verbs that have different vowel changes in their conjugations. For example:

* almak (to take) - changes to "alır," instead of "alırım" or "alırsın."

## How to use irregular verbs

Most Turkish language learners struggle with using irregular verbs correctly. To use irregular verbs, it is essential to learn their stem, conjugation, and suffix placement.

Irregular verbs require more concentration, but with practice, you can master them. It would help if you practiced writing and speaking Turkish regularly to create a strong foundation.

## Conclusion

Irregular verbs add to the complexity of learning the Turkish language. They provide an opportunity to enrich your vocabulary and challenge you to learn new conjugation patterns. By learning and incorporating these irregular verbs into your study sessions, you can improve your Turkish language skills and take a step closer to fluency.
