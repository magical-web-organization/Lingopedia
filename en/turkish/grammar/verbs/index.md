Turkish verbs are a crucial part of the language, and understanding them is essential for effective communication. Turkish verbs come in different tenses, and they change according to the subject and the object. Here's everything you need to know about Turkish verbs.

### Types of Turkish Verbs

There are four types of Turkish verbs: 

1. Regular Verbs: These verbs follow a regular pattern in their conjugation.
2. Irregular Verbs: These verbs do not follow a regular pattern in their conjugation.
3. Reflexive Verbs: These verbs indicate that the action is done by the subject to oneself.
4. Reciprocal Verbs: These verbs indicate that the action is done by two or more subjects towards each other.

### Conjugation of Turkish Verbs

Turkish verbs change according to the subject and the tense. The subject of the verb is usually shown by personal pronouns such as "Ben" (I), "Sen" (You), "O" (He/She/It), "Biz" (We), and "Siz" (You-Plural/Formal). For example, the verb "Gelmek" (to come) is conjugated as follows:

| Subject | Present Tense |
|---------|---------------|
| Ben     | Geliyorum      |
| Sen     | Geliyorsun     |
| O       | Geliyor        |
| Biz     | Geliyoruz      |
| Siz     | Geliyorsunuz   |
| Onlar   | Geliyorlar     |

As you can see, the verb "Gelmek" changes its ending based on the subject. The present tense suffixes are "-yorum", "-yorsun", "-yor", "-yoruz", "-yorsunuz", and "-yorlar".
