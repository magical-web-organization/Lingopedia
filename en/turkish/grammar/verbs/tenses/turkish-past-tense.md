Turkish language has a complex past tense system that reflects the time and aspect of the action. In Turkish, past tense is called "geçmiş zaman," which means the "time that has passed." In this article, we'll explore the Turkish past tense and learn how to use it correctly.

## Turkish Past Tense Forms

There are two types of past tense in Turkish: [-DI] and [-MIŞ]. The -DI past tense is used for completed actions in the past, while the -MIŞ tense is used for actions that have occurred recently.

### The -DI Past Tense

To form the -DI past tense, a past suffix -DI is added to the verb stem, which varies according to the verb's vowel harmony.

Vowel Harmony:

- For verbs that end with a vowel (a, ı, o, u), -DI is added directly.

   Example: Geçen hafta tatil yaptı. (She had a holiday last week.)

- For verbs that end with a consonant (b,c,d,g,ğ,l,m,n, r, z), -DI takes an additional -Y.

   Example: Kitabı bitirdi. (He finished the book.)

- For verbs with a stem ending in a vowel, the stem vowel is dropped before adding the past suffix -DI.

   Example: **Üzgün** - üzgün -> üzgün+dü -> üzgündü 

Here are some more examples of -DI past tense in Turkish:

- Başarılıydı. (He was successful.)
- Bugün yaşlı bir adamla tanıştım. (I met an old man today.)
- Sıcaktı dışarısı. (It was hot outside.)

### The -MIŞ Past Tense

The -MIŞ past tense is used for actions that happened recently, or for previously unknown information that has been recently discovered. To form the -MIŞ past tense, the past suffix -MIŞ is added to the verb stem. The final vowel of the stem is dropped, and the suffix's vowel harmony is adjusted.

Vowel Harmony:

- For verbs that end with a vowel (a, ı, o, u), -MIŞ is added directly.

   Example: Damla dün sinemada bir film izlemiş. (Damla watched a movie at the cinema yesterday.)

- For verbs that end with a consonant (b,c,d,g,ğ,l,m,n, r, z), -MIŞ takes an additional -Y.

   Example: Sen hangi şehirleri gezmışşin? (Which cities have you visited?)

- For verbs with a stem ending in a vowel, the stem vowel is dropped before adding the past suffix -MIŞ.

   Example: **Geniş** - geni+şmil -> genişmiş 

Here are some examples of -MIŞ past tense in Turkish:

- Bugün ödevini bitirmiş. (He finished his homework today.)
- Hangi filmi izlemişsin? (Which movie did you watch?)
- Bana hiçbir şey söylememişti. (He had not told me anything.)

## Usage of Turkish Past Tense

Now that we know how to use the two types of past tense in Turkish, let's look at how to use them in sentences.

### Completed Actions

The -DI past tense is used to describe completed actions in the past, irrespective of whether they happened just once or were repeated.

Example:

- Geçen hafta benim doğum günüm vardı. Past tense. (I had my birthday last week.)

### Recent Actions

The -MIŞ past tense is used for actions that occurred recently, like "just now" or "recently."

Example:

- Daha önce böyle bir iş yapmamıştım. Past perfect tense. (I had never done such a job before.)

### Time Expressions

Turkish language generally follows the time expression rules to indicate when the action occurred.

Example:

- Geçen yaz İstanbul'a gitmiştim. (I went to Istanbul last summer.)

### Reporting Verbs

Using past tense verbs to indicate another's speech, thought, or writing in Turkish often involves converting the subject and reflector as well.

Example:

- Ahmet, Ali'ye "Odamda kitapların varmış" dedi. (Ahmet said to Ali, "You have books in my room.")

### Irregular Verbs

Some common verbs in Turkish have irregular past tense forms. Here are a few examples:

- Gitmek (to go) -> Gitti (He went)
- Gel (-Come) -> Geldi (He came)
- Yapmak (-Make) -> Yaptı (He made)

So, this was a brief introduction to the Turkish past tense. Understanding and mastering the past tense is essential for communicating effectively in Turkish. If you are a beginner in the Turkish language, we hope this guide helps gain confidence in the past tense of Turkish language.
