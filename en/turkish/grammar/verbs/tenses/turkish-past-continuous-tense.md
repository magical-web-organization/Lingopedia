## Introduction

The Turkish language is spoken by over 80 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely spoken languages globally. One essential aspect of learning any language is its verb tenses. In Turkish, the past continuous tense is an essential aspect that helps individuals to convey actions in continuous progression in the past. 

This article aims to provide a detailed overview of the Turkish past continuous tense, including its formation, usage, and common examples.

## Formation of Turkish Past Continuous Tense

The past continuous tense is formed by using the "-yordu" suffix added to the verb's stem. The verb stem is the base form of the verb, without any additional endings.

For instance: 

- Gel (to come) - Gel + yordu = Geliyordu (he/she/it was coming)
- Oku (to read) - Oku + yordu = Okuyordu (he/she/it was reading)
- Yaz (to write) - Yaz + yordu = Yazıyordu (he/she/it was writing)

The form is the same across all verbs - the '-yordu' suffix is added to the verb stem's end to form the past continuous form.

## Usage of Turkish Past Continuous Tense

The past continuous tense is used to describe actions or events that were in progress in the past. This tense is used to describe actions in progress that were interrupted by another event. It is also used when there is a need to emphasize the surrounding context of an incident or an action in progress at a specific point in the past.
