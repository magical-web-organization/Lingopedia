Turkish language is a beautiful and complex language that has a variety of verb tenses, including the future continuous tense. The future continuous tense is used to describe an action that will be happening in the future and is still ongoing. In this article, we will discuss the formation, usage, and examples of the Turkish future continuous tense.

**Formation**

The Turkish future continuous tense is formed by adding the suffix "-acak/-ecek" to the stem of the verb, followed by the present continuous tense form of the verb "olmak" (to be).

For example:

| Verb | Stem | Future Continuous |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| okumak (to read) | oku- | okuyacağım (I will be reading) |
| çalışmak (to work) | çalış- | çalışacakmış (He/She will be working) |
| yürümek (to walk) | yürü- | yürüyeceğiz (We will be walking) |

**Usage**

The Turkish future continuous tense is used to describe an action that will be happening in the future and is still ongoing. It can also be used to express a prediction or assumption about a future event.

Examples:

- Ben yarın sabah evde olacağım. Okuyacağım. (I will be at home tomorrow morning. I will be reading.)
- Perşembe günü arkadaşlarımızla yürüyeceğiz. (We will be walking with our friends on Thursday.)
- Ali öğleden sonra ders çalışacakmış. (Ali will be studying in the afternoon, he said.)

**Negation**

To make a negative sentence in the future continuous tense, we add the negative suffix "-me/-ma" after the stem of the verb and before "-acak/-ecek".

Example:

- Ben yarın sabah evde olmayacağım. Okumayacağım. (I will not be at home tomorrow morning. I will not be reading.)

**Question**

To form a question in the future continuous tense, we invert the word order of the subject and the first verb.

Example:

- Yarın sabah okuyacak mısın? (Will you be reading tomorrow morning?)

In conclusion, the Turkish future continuous tense is an important tool for expressing ongoing and future events. By learning how to form and use it correctly, you can improve your Turkish language skills and communicate more effectively in Turkish.
