Turkish is a unique language that has some special features in its structure. One of these features is the existence of two different plural forms for nouns. This can be a challenging aspect for non-native learners, but once you get the hang of it, it will become easier to understand and apply.

The two different plural forms in Turkish are called “-ler” and “-lar.” In some cases, the choice of suffix depends on the last vowel of the noun. Here’s how it works:

- If the last vowel of the noun is “a,” “ı,” “o,” or “u,” then the plural suffix is “-lar.” Examples: kitaplar (books), koltuklar (chairs), ayılar (bears), babalar (fathers).

- If the last vowel of the noun is “e,” “i,” “ö,” or “ü,” then the plural suffix is “-ler.” Examples: resimler (paintings), öğrenciler (students), kapılar (doors), köpekler (dogs).

However, this rule is not always applicable, as there are some exceptions. Some nouns change their last vowel when the plural suffix (-lar or -ler) is added. For example:

- Güneş (sun) becomes güneşler (suns) instead of *güneşlar.
- Ağaç (tree) becomes ağaçlar (trees) instead of *ağaçler.

Additionally, some Turkish nouns have both -lar and -ler as their plural forms, and their usage depends on the context of the sentence. For example:

- El (hand) can be pluralized as either eller or eler, but the latter is more common when referring to different hands. Examples: İki elerimizi de yıka. (Wash both of our hands.) Elleri havada sallamak. (Wave hands in the air.)

- Gün (day) can be pluralized as either günler or gunlar, but the former is more common when referring to consecutive days. Examples: O günlerde çok çalıştım. (I worked a lot in those days.) Haftada iki gun boşum. (I am free for two days a week.)

In conclusion, while Turkish nouns have two different plural forms, it is important to keep in mind the exceptions that may arise due to vowel changes or context. By understanding the difference between -lar and -ler, as well as the various scenarios they can be used in, learners can improve their language skills in speaking and writing in Turkish.
