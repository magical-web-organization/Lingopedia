In Turkish grammar, possession is indicated by adding a suffix to a noun. This is a common feature in many languages, and Turkish is no exception. The suffix that is used depends on the relationship between the possessor and the possessed. In this article, we will explore the different suffixes used in Turkish to indicate possession.

## The Basics

In Turkish, the basic form of a noun is called its root or stem. The root is the form that is listed in dictionaries and is used in isolation. However, when a noun is used to indicate possession, a suffix is added to the root.

The possessive suffixes in Turkish are as follows:

| Possessor | Suffix |
| --- | --- |
| Ben (I) | -im |
| Sen (you, singular) | -in |
| O (he, she, it) | -i |
| Biz (we) | -imiz |
| Siz (you, plural) | -iniz |
| Onlar (they) | -leri |

## Examples

Let's look at some examples to see how possession is indicated in Turkish:

- Kitap (book) becomes benim kitabım (my book)
- Araba (car) becomes senin arabını (your car)
- Ev (house) becomes onun evi (his/her/its house)
- Defter (notebook) becomes bizim defterimiz (our notebook)
- Bilgisayar (computer) becomes sizin bilgisayarınız (your computer)
- Kitaplık (bookcase) becomes onların kitaplıkları (their bookcase)

## Additional Notes

- The suffix is added to the end of the noun, and the vowel that precedes the suffix is determined by vowel harmony.
- If the noun ends in a vowel, an apostrophe is used before adding the suffix. For example: çay (tea) becomes benim çayım (my tea).
- If the noun ends in a consonant cluster, the suffix is added to the last consonant. For example: takvim (calendar) becomes senin takvimin (your calendar).

In conclusion, indicating possession in Turkish is relatively straightforward. By adding a suffix to a noun, you can easily communicate who owns what. With some practice, you'll be able to use these suffixes with ease, and it'll become second nature.
