In Turkish, subordinating conjunctions are used to connect subordinate clauses to main clauses to form complex sentences. Subordinate clauses contain a subject and a predicate, but they cannot stand alone as a sentence because they depend on the main clause. Some common subordinating conjunctions in Turkish include "çünkü" (because), "gibi" (like), and "eğer" (if).

- **Çünkü** \- because
Çünkü is used to introduce a subordinate clause that explains why something happened. It is used to connect the reason for an action to the action itself. For example, "Çalışmam gerekiyor **çünkü** sınavım var." (I need to study **because** I have an exam.)

- **Gibi** \- like, as
Gibi is used to compare two things or to describe something as similar to something else. It is often used to introduce a subordinate clause that describes a similarity. For example, "Sarı saçlı bir kız **gibi** görünüyor." (She looks **like** a girl with blonde hair.)

- **Eğer** \- if
Eğer is used to introduce a hypothetical situation or a condition that must be met for something else to happen. It can be translated as "if" or "in case." For example, "Eğer yarın yağmur yağarsa, evde kalacağız." (If it rains tomorrow, we will stay at home.)

- **Ki** \- that
Ki is used to introduce a subordinate clause that provides additional information about the main clause. It can often be translated as "that" or "which." For example, "Sana bir şey anlatayım **ki** ne kadar önemli olduğunu anlayasın." (Let me tell you something **so that** you understand how important it is.)

- **Ama** \- but
Ama is used to introduce a subordinate clause that contrasts with the meaning of the main clause. It is used to connect contrasting ideas. For example, "Bugün güzel bir gündü, **ama** şimdi yağmur yağıyor." (Today was a beautiful day, **but** now it's raining.)

In Turkish, subordinating conjunctions can be used to form complex sentences that provide more detailed information and make writing and speaking more sophisticated. By understanding these subordinating conjunctions and how to use them, you can create more complex and rich sentences in Turkish.
