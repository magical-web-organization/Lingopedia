Turkish, like every other language out there, has its own set of conjunctions that connect words, phrases, clauses and sentences. Conjunctions are an essential part of speech as they help us connect our thoughts and ideas in a more cohesive manner. In this guide, we will be discussing some of the most common Turkish conjunctions and their uses.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions, as the name suggests, connect two independent clauses or words of equal rank. These types of conjunctions are commonly used in Turkish and can be broken down into two groups:

1. **İkileme Bağlaçları**

İkileme bağlaçları, also known as correlative conjunctions, are conjunctions that connect two elements of the same type in a sentence. In Turkish, there are five types of ikileme bağlaçları:

- **hem...hem** - both...and
- **ne...ne** - neither...nor
- **ya...ya** - either...or
- **ya da...ya da** - either...or
- **değil...ama** - not...but

Example: Hem güzel hem pahalı. (It's both beautiful and expensive.)

2. **Bağlaçlar**

Bağlaçlar, also known as coordinating conjunctions, join two independent clauses of equal rank in a sentence. In Turkish, there are seven types of bağlaçlar:

- **ve** - and
- **ama** - but
- **fakat** - however
- **veya** - or
- **yahut** - or
- **çünkü** - because
- **zira** - for

Example: Ben dün sinemaya gittim ve filmi beğendim. (I went to the cinema yesterday and I liked the movie.)

### Subordinating Conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions connect two clauses of unequal rank, with one clause being dependent on the other. These types of conjunctions can be broken down into several groups:

1. **Zarf Bağlaçları**

Zarf bağlaçları, also known as adverbial conjunctions, connect clauses to modify the verb in the sentence. In Turkish, there are many types of zarf bağlaçları, including:

- **ama** - but
- **çünkü** - because
- **amaçla** - with the intention of
- **göre** - according to
- **eğer** - if
- **ki** - that
- **ne zaman** - when
- **rağmen** - despite
- **şöyle ki** - namely
- **ta ki** - until
- **yani** - that is

Example: Geç kalmamın sebebi, trafik sıkışıklığıydı. (The reason I was late was because of traffic congestion.)

2. **Sıfat Bağlaçları**

Sıfat bağlaçları, also known as adjectival conjunctions, connect clauses to modify the noun in the sentence. In Turkish, there are only two types of sıfat bağlaçları:

- **ki** - that
- **ile** - with

Example: Benim kahve içtiğim bardak, seninkinden farklıdır. (The cup that I drink coffee from is different from yours.)

3. **Fiilimsi Bağlaçları**

Fiilimsi bağlaçları, also known as nominal conjunctions or gerund conjunctions, connect clauses to modify the noun or verb in the sentence. In Turkish, there are several types of fiilimsi bağlaçları, including:

- **-dığı için** - because of
- **-dıkça** - as much as
- **-maksızın** - without

Example: İşini doğru yapmadığı için kovuldum. (I was fired because I didn't do my job right.)

In conclusion, Turkish conjunctions are an essential part of speech that help connect clauses and ideas in a sentence. By understanding the different types of conjunctions and how they are used, one can better express their thoughts and ideas in both written and spoken Turkish.
