Chinese aspectual verbs are important components of the Chinese language. These verbs indicate the way the action or event is perceived, expressing how long it lasts, and whether it is complete, ongoing, or repeated.

Let us explore some of the most commonly used aspectual verbs in Chinese.

他不高兴了 (tā bù gāo xìng le) - He is not happy anymore (change of state).

### 2. 着 (zhe)
