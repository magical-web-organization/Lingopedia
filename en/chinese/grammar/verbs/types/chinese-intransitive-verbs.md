Chinese intransitive verbs are verbs that do not take a direct object. They only have a subject which performs the action. In Chinese, intransitive verbs are often used to describe actions or events which occur without affecting any external object. This article will explain the usage of intransitive verbs in the Chinese language.

## Types of Chinese Intransitive Verbs

There are five types of Chinese intransitive verbs: 

1. Action verbs: These are verbs which are used to express an action or movement by the subject. Examples of action verbs include "run," "swim," and "dance."

2. State verbs: These are verbs which describe a temporary or permanent state of the subject. Examples of state verbs include "be," "feel," and "think."

3. Change of state verbs: These are verbs which express a change in the subject's state. Examples of change of state verbs include "get sick," "fall asleep," and "grow old."

4. Perception verbs: These are verbs which describe the mental processes of the subject. Examples of perception verbs include "see," "hear," and "smell."

5. Existential verbs: These are verbs which are used to indicate the existence of the subject. Examples of existential verbs include "exist," "appear," and "happen."

## Usage of Chinese Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive verbs are often used in Chinese to describe actions or events that occur without affecting any external object. Here are some examples of how intransitive verbs may be used in Chinese:

1. 他跑了。 (Tā pǎo le.) - He ran.

They are often used with adverbs or adverbial phrases to provide additional information about the action or event.
