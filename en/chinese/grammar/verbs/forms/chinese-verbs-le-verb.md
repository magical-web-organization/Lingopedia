# Chinese Verbs: Le Verb

As you delve deeper into the Chinese language, you will come across a variety of sentence structures that incorporate different verbs to convey meaning. One such verb is the **Le verb**, one of the most commonly used verbs in Mandarin Chinese. 

## What is the Le verb?

The Le verb is a dynamic particle in Mandarin Chinese that indicates the completion of an action. It can be translated into English as "already did" or "have done," depending on the context of the sentence. 

In Chinese grammar, the Le verb is placed after the verb to indicate that an action has been completed. For instance, if you want to say "I ate breakfast," you would say "我吃完早餐了" (Wǒ chī wán zǎo cān le) - the word "Le" indicates that the speaker has finished eating breakfast.

## Usage of the Le Verb

The Le verb is used to indicate the completion of an action in Mandarin Chinese. It is commonly used in sentences that describe an accomplished action or state, and its use can change the meaning of a sentence. 

In its most basic form, the Le verb can be added to an action verb. This can be used to describe a past action that has been completed, like "I have eaten," or to indicate that an action has just been completed, like "I just finished eating." 

However, it is important to note that the Le verb is not always used to indicate past tense in Chinese. Instead, it can also be used to convey a change in state, such as "I'm full," or "I'm tired." In these cases, the Le verb indicates a state of being that has occurred, rather than an action that was completed. 

## Grammatical Rules

When using the Le verb in a sentence, there are a few grammatical rules that you should follow to ensure that your sentence is correct. These include:

- The Le verb must be placed after the verb it is modifying. 
- When used with a verb, it is usually placed before the sentence-ending particle "le".
- The Le verb must agree in tense with its preceding verb. 

Additionally, the Le verb must be used in conjunction with a time adverb or time phrase to indicate when an action was completed. This can include words like "yesterday," "last night," or "this morning," as well as phrases like "just now" or "recently." 

## Examples

- 我吃饭了 (Wǒ chī fàn le) - I have eaten.
- 我去看电影了 (Wǒ qù kàn diàn yǐng le) - I have gone to see a movie.
- 我刚刚写完作业了 (Wǒ gāng gāng xiě wán zuò yè le) - I just finished my homework.
- 我们已经走了10分钟了 (Wǒmen yǐjīng zǒu le shí fēnzhōng le) - We have already walked for 10 minutes.

## Conclusion

The Le verb is an important grammar structure in Mandarin Chinese that is used to indicate the completion of an action. By following the basic grammatical rules and using time adverbs, you can easily convey past tense in your sentences. As you continue to practice your Chinese language skills, be sure to incorporate the Le verb into your everyday conversations to become more fluent and natural in your use of the language.
