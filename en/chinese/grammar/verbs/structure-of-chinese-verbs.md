# Structure of Chinese Verbs

Chinese verbs are a crucial part of the Chinese language, and understanding their structure is key to speaking and writing fluently. In this guide, we'll explore the different aspects of Chinese verb structure, including verb forms, types and tense.

## Verb Forms

There are several verb forms in Chinese, each indicating a different aspect of the verb. Here are the most common forms:

### Simple Verb

The simple verb form is the basic form of the verb, expressing an action or state without any additional information. For example:

- 我喝水。 (Wǒ hē shuǐ) - I drink water.

### Le Verb

The Le verb form is used to indicate the completion of an action. It's often used with time expressions to show when an action was finished. For example:

- 我吃了饭。 (Wǒ chīle fàn) - I have finished eating.

### Zhe Verb

The Zhe verb form is used to indicate that an action is ongoing. It's often used with adverbs to express how an action is happening. For example:

- 我在吃饭。 (Wǒ zài chīfàn) - I am eating.

### Guo Verb

The Guo verb form is used to indicate that an action has been experienced. It's often used with adverbs to show how an action was experienced. For example:

- 我去过中国。 (Wǒ qù guò zhōngguó) - I have been to China.

## Verb Types

There are several verb types in Chinese, each indicating a different aspect of the verb. Here are the most common types:

### Action Verbs

Action verbs are used to describe actions, movements or changes. For example:

- 跳舞 (tiàowǔ) - to dance
- 买东西 (mǎi dōngxī) - to buy things

### State Verbs

State verbs are used to describe a state, condition or situation. For example:

- 睡觉 (shuìjiào) - to sleep
- 快乐 (kuàilè) - to be happy

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are used to express an attitude or opinion towards the event described by the verb. For example:

- 能 (néng) - can
- 应该 (yīnggāi) - ought to

## Verb Tenses

Chinese has no clear distinction between past, present and future tense. Instead, the tense is often inferred from context or time expressions. Here are some common time expressions used with Chinese verbs:

- 昨天 (zuótiān) - yesterday
- 现在 (xiànzài) - now
- 明天 (míngtiān) - tomorrow

### Past Tense

To indicate the past tense, the Le verb form is often used with past time expressions. For example:

- 昨天我吃了饭。 (Zuótiān wǒ chīle fàn) - I ate yesterday.

### Present Tense

The present tense is often indicated by the simple verb form, or the Zhe verb form with the time expression 现在 (xiànzài). For example:

- 我在学习中文。 (Wǒ zài xuéxí zhōngwén) - I am studying Chinese.

### Future Tense

The future tense is often indicated by the simple verb form with future time expressions. For example:

- 明天我会打电话给你。 (Míngtiān wǒ huì dǎ diànhuà gěi nǐ) - I will call you tomorrow.

Understanding Chinese verb structure is essential to learning the language. With this guide, you should have a good grasp of the different verb forms, types and tenses. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep practicing your Chinese verbs!
