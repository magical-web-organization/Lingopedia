As one of the most critical parts of the Chinese language, it's essential for learners to understand the future tense or 将来时 (jiāng lái shí). The future tense in Chinese is used to describe an event that will occur in the future, such as making plans, setting goals, or discussing future events with others.

Here is everything you need to know about using the Chinese Future Tense:

## The Formulation of the Chinese Future Tense

To form the Chinese Future Tense, you need to use the auxiliary word "将" (jiāng), which is placed before the verb. The auxiliary word 会 (huì) can also be used in some contexts. 

Let's look at some examples:

- 我将去 (wǒ jiāng qù) - I will go
- 明天我将吃饭 (míngtiān wǒ jiāng chīfàn) - I will eat tomorrow
- 我会去 (wǒ huì qù) - I will go

## Using Time Words with the Chinese Future Tense

Like any tense, using time words is vital in the Chinese Future Tense. Time words are known as complements in Chinese grammar.

Some common complements for the Future Tense are:

- 明天 (míngtiān) - Tomorrow
- 后天 (hòutiān) - The day after tomorrow
- 下周 (xià zhōu) - Next week
- 明年 (míngnián) - Next year

Take a look at these examples:

- 明天我将去北京 (míngtiān wǒ jiāng qù běijīng) - I will go to Beijing tomorrow
- 下周我们将开会 (xià zhōu wǒmen jiāng kāihuì) - We will have a meeting next week.
- 明年他将去美国 (míngnián tā jiāng qù měiguó) - He will go to America next year.

## Making Negative Sentences with the Chinese Future Tense

We use "不" (bù), which means "no," "not," or "don't," to create negative sentences. 

For example:

- 我不会去 (wǒ bù huì qù) - I won't go
- 我明天不会去 (wǒ míngtiān bù huì qù) - I won't go tomorrow

We also use the negative word "没有" (méiyǒu), which means "not to have," to indicate that an action will not happen.

For example:

- 我明天没有时间 (wǒ míngtiān méiyǒu shíjiān) - I won't have time tomorrow

## Making Questions with the Chinese Future Tense

To ask questions in the future tense, simply add the interrogative particle 吗 (ma) to the statement.

For example:

- 你明天去学校吗？(nǐ míngtiān qù xuéxiào ma?) - Will you go to school tomorrow?
- 他们后天会开会吗？(tāmen hòutiān huì kāihuì ma?) - Will they have a meeting the day after tomorrow?

## Using Aspects with the Chinese Future Tense

Aspects are used to indicate whether an action is ongoing or has been completed. There are two aspect markers in Chinese: "了" (le) and "着" (zhe).

The aspect marker "了" (le) is used to show that an action has been completed.

For example:

- 我明天会学习了 (wǒ míngtiān huì xuéxí le) - I will have studied tomorrow 
- 我吃完饭了再打电话 (wǒ chī wán fàn le zài dǎ diànhuà) - I'll call you back after I finish eating.

The aspect marker "着" (zhe) is used to show that an action is ongoing.

For example:

- 我在学习着 (wǒ zài xuéxí zhe) - I am studying now
- 他们在等着我们 (tāmen zài děng zhe wǒmen) - They are waiting for us
