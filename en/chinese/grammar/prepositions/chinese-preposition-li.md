## Introduction
Prepositions are used to indicate the relationship between two words in a sentence. In Chinese, the preposition 离 (lí) is commonly used to express proximity or distance between two objects. Understanding the proper usage of 离 is crucial in conveying the intended message accurately. In this article, we will discuss the meaning, usage, and variations of 离 in different contexts.

## Meaning
离 (lí) is a preposition that translates to "away from" or "at a distance from" in English. It is used to express the spatial or temporal distance between two objects or events. The character 离 is composed of two parts: 阝 (fù) and 离 (lí). 阝 is a radical indicating a hill or a mound and can convey the meaning of separation. The character 离 (lí) itself means "to separate" or "to break away from."
