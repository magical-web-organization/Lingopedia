In Mandarin Chinese, 的 (de) is a very common particle that plays an important role in grammar and conversation. In this article, we will cover the basics of 的, including its meaning, usage, and examples.

## Meaning

的 is a particle that serves as a possessive marker and connects modifiers or attributes to a noun. Some translations of 的 include "of", "'s", and "that/which", depending on the context.

## Usage

### Possession

In Chinese, the possessive relationship between two things or people is expressed using 的. For example, the sentence "This is Tom's book" could be translated to "这是Tom的书" (zhè shì Tom de shū).

### Modify nouns

的 is also used to connect adjectives, nouns, and other modifiers to a noun. For example, the sentence "I want to eat spicy chicken" could be translated to "我想吃辣的鸡肉" (wǒ xiǎng chī là de jīròu), where 辣的 (là de) modifies the noun 鸡肉 (jīròu).

### Comparison

的 can also be used to compare two things or people. For example, "He is taller than me" could be translated to "他比我高的" (tā bǐ wǒ gāo de).

### Indicating a relative clause

的 can be used to introduce a relative clause that modifies a noun. For example, the sentence "I have a friend who speaks Chinese well" can be translated to "我有一个说中文说得好的朋友" (wǒ yǒu yī gè shuō zhōngwén shuō de hǎo de péngyǒu).
