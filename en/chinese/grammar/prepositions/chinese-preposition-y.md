As you continue to learn Chinese, you will come across many prepositions that can be difficult to comprehend for English speakers. One of these is 以 (yǐ), which can mean many different things depending on the context it is used in. In this article, we will explore the various meanings and uses of 以 in Chinese sentences.

### Basic Meaning

The primary meaning of 以 (yǐ) is "with" or "by means of". When used in a sentence, it is usually followed by a noun or verb that indicates the means or method being used. For example:

- 我们以电子邮件联系 (wǒmen yǐ diànzǐ yóujiàn liánxì) - We contact via email.
- 她以画画为生 (tā yǐ huà huà wéi shēng) - She makes her living by painting.

In these sentences, 以 is used to describe the method or means of communication (email) and a profession (painting).

### Other Meanings

In addition to "with" or "by means of", 以 (yǐ) can also have a few other meanings depending on the context:

- 以...为 (yǐ...wéi) - to take something as a standard or basis
- 以为 (yǐwéi) - to believe or think something
- 以免 (yǐmiǎn) - to avoid something

Let's look at each of these in more detail. 

#### 以...为

When 以 (yǐ) is followed by a noun and the character 为 (wéi), it means to take something as a standard or basis. For example:

- 以他的成绩为基准，她觉得自己很不错 (yǐ tā de chéngjì wéi jīzhǔn, tā juédé zìjǐ hěn bùcuò) - Using his grades as a benchmark, she thinks highly of herself.

In this sentence, the speaker is using "his grades" as a basis for comparison to judge herself. 

#### 以为

The phrase 以为 (yǐwéi) is used to indicate a belief or thought. For example:

- 我以为你不来了 (wǒ yǐwéi nǐ bù lái le) - I thought you weren't coming.

Here, 以为 is used to show a belief or expectation that was later found to be incorrect.

#### 以免

The phrase 以免 (yǐmiǎn) means "to avoid something". For example:

- 我提醒你带伞，以免下雨 (wǒ tíxǐng nǐ dài sǎn, yǐmiǎn xiàyǔ) - I remind you to bring an umbrella, so as to avoid getting caught in the rain.

In this sentence, 以免 is used to indicate the purpose of the reminder - to avoid getting wet in the rain.

### Conclusion

As with many Chinese words, 以 (yǐ) can have multiple meanings depending on the context it is used in. Its primary meaning is "with" or "by means of", but it can also mean "to take something as a standard or basis", "to believe or think something", or "to avoid something". By understanding the various meanings and uses of 以, you can effectively communicate in Chinese and add nuance to your speech.
