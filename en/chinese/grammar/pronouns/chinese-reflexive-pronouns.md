# Chinese Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are used to refer back to the subject of the sentence. In Chinese, reflexive pronouns are used quite differently from English. In this article, we will discuss the different Chinese reflexive pronouns and how they are used in Chinese language.

## 1. "Ziji" (自己)

"Ziji" is the most common reflexive pronoun in Chinese. It is used when the subject and the object of the action are the same.

- 我自己做饭。 (Wǒ zìjǐ zuòfàn.) - I cook for myself.
- 她自己开车。 (Tā zìjǐ kāichē.) - She drives herself.

## 2. "Tamen Ziji" (他们自己/她们自己)

"Tamen ziji" is used to indicate that a group of people have done something by themselves or for themselves.

- 他们自己做了一顿丰盛的晚餐。(Tāmen zìjǐ zuò le yīdùn fēngshèng de wǎncān.) - They cooked themselves a delicious dinner.
- 她们自己选购了新的衣服。(Tāmen zìjǐ xuǎn gòu le xīn de yīfú.) - They bought themselves new clothes.

## 3. "Ziji de" (自己的)

"Ziji de" is used to show possession.

- 我的房间很干净，因为我自己清理的。(Wǒ de fángjiān hěn gānjìng, yīnwèi wǒ zìjǐ qīnglǐ de.) - My room is very clean because I cleaned it myself.
- 我们公司的员工都很喜欢自己的工作。(Wǒmen gōngsī de yuángōng dōu hěn xǐhuan zìjǐ de gōngzuò.) - The employees in our company all love their own jobs.

## 4. "Lian" (连)

"Lian" is used to emphasize that the subject does the action by themselves without any outside help.

- 他自己连晚餐都不会做。(Tā zìjǐ lián wǎncān dōu bù huì zuò.) - He can’t even cook dinner by himself.
- 她自己连自行车都不会骑。(Tā zìjǐ lián zìxíngchē dōu bù huì qí.) - She can’t even ride a bike by herself.
