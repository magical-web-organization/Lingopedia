## Introduction
Comparative adjectives are a type of adjectives that we use in language to compare two or more things. In Chinese, comparative adjectives are formed by adding a character to the end of an adjective. In this article, we will discuss how to form and use comparative adjectives in Chinese.

## Formation
To form a comparative adjective in Chinese, you can add the character “比” (bǐ) after the adjective. For example, if the adjective is “高” (gāo), which means “tall”, then the comparative adjective would be “比较高” (bǐ jiào gāo), which means “taller.”

There are different forms of “比” that can be used to form comparative adjectives. We can use “比” alone or add other characters to it, such as “比较” (bǐ jiào) or “更” (gèng). Using “比较” indicates a comparison, while adding “更” expresses a higher degree. For example, “更高” (gèng gāo) means “higher than,” while “比较高” (bǐ jiào gāo) means “comparatively high.”

## Usage
Comparative adjectives in Chinese are used in the same way as they are used in English. We use them to compare two or more things, to express which one is superior or inferior to another. Comparative adjectives are often used when we want to express a change in degree or quantity. For example, “这个苹果比那个大” (zhè gè píng guǒ bǐ nà gè dà) means “This apple is bigger than that one.”

In Chinese, comparative adjectives can also be used to show a decrease or increase in degree. For example, “今天比昨天冷” (jīn tiān bǐ zuó tiān lěng) means “Today is colder than yesterday,” and “明天会更热” (míng tiān huì gèng rè) means “Tomorrow will be hotter.”

## Examples
Here are some examples of comparative adjectives in Chinese:

- 今天比昨天冷。 (jīn tiān bǐ zuó tiān lěng) - Today is colder than yesterday.
- 这个苹果比那个大。 (zhè gè píng guǒ bǐ nà gè dà) - This apple is bigger than that one.
- 我的房间比你的房间干净。 (wǒ de fáng jiān bǐ nǐ de fáng jiān gān jìng) - My room is cleaner than yours.
- 这个城市比那个城市繁华。 (zhè gè chéng shì bǐ nà gè chéng shì fán huá) - This city is more prosperous than that city.

## Conclusion
Comparative adjectives are an important part of Chinese grammar. They help us compare things and express changes in degree or quantity. Keep in mind that there are different forms of “比” that can be used to form comparative adjectives, depending on the degree of comparison we want to express. With practice and familiarity, using comparative adjectives will become second nature.
