# Understanding the Korean Imperative Tense

Korean is one of the most spoken languages in the world. It has an interesting grammar structure, which might be challenging to learn for some foreigners. One tense that you would definitely come across in your Korean learning journey is the imperative tense. In this article, we will dive deep into the Korean imperative tense and how it's used in different situations.

## What is the Imperative Tense?

The imperative tense is used to give commands, make requests, or give advice. It's used to express urgent and direct actions. In Korean, there are two forms of the imperative tense - formal and informal. Formal imperative tense is used to address strangers or people who are older than you, while informal imperative tense is used in a casual conversation with people who are younger than you or same age as you. Let's take a look at the differences between the two forms.

### Formal Imperative Tense

Formal imperative tense is formed by adding -십시오(-shipshiyo) to the verb stem. For instance, let's take the verb 가다(gada), which means to go. The formal imperative tense for 가다(gada) is 가십시오(gashipshiyo), which means 'Go!'. You can use this form to give commands or orders to someone who is older or in a higher position.

### Informal Imperative Tense

The informal imperative tense is formed by adding -아/-어/-해(-a/-eo/-hae) to the verb stem. The form depends on the last vowel of the verb stem. If the verb stem ends with a vowel, you should add -아/-어/-해(-a/-eo/-hae), whereas if the verb stem ends with a consonant, you should add -어/-해(-eo/-hae). Let's take the verb 먹다(meokda), which means to eat. The informal imperative tense for 먹다(meokda) would be 먹어(meogeo), which means 'Eat!'. You can use this form when talking to your friends, family, or someone younger than you.

## How to Use the Imperative Tense

Now that you know about the differences between formal and informal imperative tense let's take a look at how to use them in different situations.

### Giving Commands

To give commands or orders, you should use the imperative tense. For example, if you want to say 'Clean the room!', you can use the formal imperative tense by saying '방을 청소하십시오!'(Bangeul cheongsohasipsio!) or the informal imperative tense by saying '방을 청소해!(Bangeul cheongsohae!)'.

### Making Requests

To make requests, you can use both formal and informal imperative tense. However, it's more polite to use the formal imperative tense when making requests. For instance, if you want to say 'Please, give me a glass of water', you can use the formal imperative tense by saying '물을 한잔 주십시오'(Mureul hanjan jusipsio!) or the informal imperative tense by saying '물 한잔 주세요'(Mul hanjan juseyo).

### Giving Advice

To give advice, you can use both formal and informal imperative tense. However, it's more appropriate to use the formal imperative tense when giving advice to someone who is older or in a higher position. For instance, if you want to say 'You should study hard to pass the exam', you can use the formal imperative tense by saying '시험을 통과하려면 열심히 공부하십시오'(Sihameul tonggwaharyeomeun yeolsimhi gongbuhasipsio!) or the informal imperative tense by saying '시험을 통과하려면 열심히 공부해!(Sihameul tonggwaharyeomeun yeolsimhi gongbuhae!).

## Conclusion
