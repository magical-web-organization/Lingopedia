If you want to express an ongoing action or the status of the current situation in Korean, you can use the present progressive tense. In Korean, the present progressive tense is expressed by adding the suffix '-고 있다' (-go itda) to the verb stem. Let's dive into more detail about the Korean Present Progressive Tense.

### Formation

The Korean present progressive tense is formed by attaching the suffix '-고 있다' (-go itda) to the verb stem. The suffix is added to the verb stem according to the final character of the stem. If the final character of the stem is a vowel, simply add '-고 있다' (-go itda) to it. However, if the final character of the stem is a consonant, add '-으' (-eu) before '-고 있다' (-go itda) to make it easier to pronounce.

For example, let's see how to form the present progressive tense of the verb '하다' (to do):

- 하다 (ha-da) → 하고 있다 (ha-go itda)

And now, let's see how to form the present progressive tense of the verb '먹다' (to eat):

- 먹다 (meok-da) → 먹고 있다 (meok-go itda)

### Usage

The present progressive tense is used to describe a current action or state in progress, which means that an action is happening at the moment of speaking or for extended periods. Let's look at some examples:

- 나는 지금 물을 마시고 있어요. (na-neun ji-geum mul-eul ma-si-go i-sseo-yo) – I am drinking water now.
- 그 사람은 지금 책을 읽고 있어요. (geu sa-ram-eun ji-geum chaek-eul il-ko i-sseo-yo) – That person is reading a book now.

### Negation

To make a negative present progressive sentence, '안' (an) or '못' (mot) is inserted before '-고 있다' (-go itda) in the present progressive form. Here are some examples:

- 나 지금 숙제를 안하고 있어. (na ji-geum suk-je-reul an-ha-go i-sseo) – I am not doing homework now.
- 그 친구는 지금 운동을 못하고 있어. (geu chin-gu-neun ji-geum un-dong-eul mot-ha-go i-sseo) - My friend cannot exercise now.
