The Korean language has various types of tenses which are used in different situations. The future progressive tense is one such tense that is used to talk about events that will be in progress at some point in the future. In this article, we will discuss how the Korean future progressive tense is formed and when it is used.

## Forming the Korean Future Progressive Tense

To form the Korean future progressive tense, we need to first understand how the Korean language conjugates verbs. Korean verbs do not change based on their subjects, unlike other languages such as English, Spanish, or French. Instead, the ending of the verb changes depending on the tense, mood, and aspect.

To create the Korean future progressive tense, we need to use the verb ending “(으)ㄹ 거에요” which roughly translates to “will be doing”. Here’s an example:

- 가다 (to go) + -ㄹ 거에요 = 갈 거에요 (will be going)

The verb ending “(으)ㄹ 거에요” is added after the stem of the verb, which is the verb without its ending. For example, in the above example, the stem of the verb 가다 is 갈. Similarly, we can create the Korean future progressive tense for other verbs by using their stems.

It is important to note that the verb ending “(으)ㄹ 거에요” can be shortened to “(으)ㄹ게요” or “(으)ㄹ께요”. However, they all have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.

## When to Use the Korean Future Progressive Tense

The Korean future progressive tense is used to talk about events that will be in progress at a specific point in the future. This tense is often used to describe actions that will be happening at the time of the speaker's future reference. For example:

- 내일은 영화를 보러 갈 거에요. (I will be watching a movie tomorrow.)

In the above example, the speaker plans to watch a movie tomorrow, and the action will be in progress at the future point of reference, which is tomorrow.

The Korean future progressive tense can also be used to make predictions about the future. The speaker might use this tense to convey their expectations or assumptions about what is going to happen. For example:

- 이번 주말에는 비가 올 거에요. (It will be raining this weekend.)

In the above example, the speaker is using the future progressive tense to make a prediction about the weather.

## Conclusion

The Korean future progressive tense is a useful grammar point for anyone who wants to talk about future events that will be in progress. By adding the verb ending “(으)ㄹ 거에요” to the stem of a verb, we can easily create this tense. We use this tense to talk about future events that will be ongoing at a particular point in time or to make predictions about future occurrences. As with any other tense, remember to practice, practice, practice for mastery!
