Korean verb tenses may seem daunting at first, especially if you are used to languages that have only simple past, present, and future tenses. However, once you understand the basics, Korean verb tenses are actually quite straightforward. In this article, we will cover the major tenses and how to conjugate Korean verbs.

## Basic Tenses

### Present Tense

The present tense in Korean is used to describe actions that are currently happening or ongoing. To conjugate verbs into the present tense, simply remove the 다 ending and add 아/어/여 depending on the last vowel of the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Present Tense |
|------|---------------|
| 가다 | 가요          |
| 먹다 | 먹어요        |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아해요  |

### Past Tense

The past tense in Korean is used to describe actions that have already happened. To conjugate verbs into the past tense, remove the 다 ending and add 았/었/였 depending on the last vowel of the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Past Tense |
|------|------------|
| 가다 | 갔어요   |
| 먹다 | 먹었어요 |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아했어요 |

### Future Tense

The future tense in Korean is used to describe actions that will happen in the future. To conjugate verbs into the future tense, add 겠 after the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Future Tense |
|------|--------------|
| 가다 | 갈 거예요    |
| 먹다 | 먹을 거예요  |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아할 거야 |

## Other Tenses

### Present Progressive Tense

The present progressive (or present continuous) tense is used to describe actions that are currently happening or ongoing. To form the present progressive tense in Korean, use the present tense of the verb 이다 (to be) and add 고 있다 after the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Present Progressive Tense |
|------|--------------------------|
| 가다 | 가고 있다                 |
| 먹다 | 먹고 있다               |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아하고 있다         |

### Past Progressive Tense

The past progressive tense is used to describe actions that were in progress in the past. To form the past progressive tense in Korean, use the past tense of the verb 이다 (to be) and add 고 있었다 after the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Past Progressive Tense |
|------|----------------------|
| 가다 | 갔고 있었다           |
| 먹다 | 먹고 있었다         |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아했고 있었다   |

### Future Progressive Tense

The future progressive tense is used to describe actions that will be in progress in the future. To form the future progressive tense in Korean, use the future tense of the verb 이다 (to be) and add 고 있을 거예요 after the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Future Progressive Tense |
|------|-------------------------|
| 가다 | 갈 거고 있을 거예요     |
| 먹다 | 먹을 거고 있을 거예요   |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아할 거고 있을 거야 |

### Imperative Tense

The imperative tense is used to give commands or make requests. In Korean, the imperative tense is formed by using the present tense of the verb and adding 어/아/여 depending on the last vowel of the verb stem.

For example:

| Verb | Imperative Tense |
|------|-----------------|
| 가다 | 가세요          |
| 먹다 | 먹어            |
| 좋아하다 | 좋아해        |
