# Korean Verbs

Verbs are one of the most important parts of speech in Korean language. They are used to describe an action or a state of being. Unlike English, Korean verbs always come at the end of the sentence. Let's take a look at some rules for conjugating Korean verbs, as well as some common verbs that you'll encounter in everyday conversation.

## Conjugating Korean Verbs

There are several verb endings that you can add to the stem of a Korean verb to conjugate it. Here are some of the most common ones:

- **-아/-어**: This ending is used to make a sentence in the present tense. The ending you use depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the final consonant is a vowel, you use **-아**. If it's a consonant, you use **-어**. For example:

  - 가다 (to go) becomes 갑니다 (goes)
  - 먹다 (to eat) becomes 먹어요 (eats)

- **-었-/-았-**: This ending is used to make a sentence in the past tense. Again, the ending you use depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the final consonant is a vowel, you add **-었-**. If it's a consonant, you add **-았-**. For example:

  - 가다 (to go) becomes 갔습니다 (went)
  - 먹다 (to eat) becomes 먹었어요 (ate)

- **-을/-를**: This ending is used to indicate that the verb is in the future tense. It's added after the verb stem. For example:

  - 가다 (to go) becomes 갈 거예요 (will go)
  - 먹다 (to eat) becomes 먹을 거예요 (will eat)

## Common Korean Verbs

Here are some of the most commonly used verbs in Korean language:

1. **하다** (to do): This verb is used to describe any action you may take. It's used in many compound verbs, such as 공부하다 (to study), 운동하다 (to exercise), and 일하다 (to work).

2. **있다** (to exist): This verb is used to indicate that something or someone exists. For example, 나는 여기 있어요 (I'm here).

3. **가다** (to go): This verb is used to describe movement. You may use it to say things such as "I'm going to school" (학교에 가고 있어요).

4. **오다** (to come): This verb is used to describe movement towards the speaker. For example, "Come here" (여기 오세요).

5. **먹다** (to eat): This verb is used to describe the act of eating. For example, "I'm eating dinner" (저는 저녁을 먹고 있어요).

6. **자다** (to sleep): This verb is used to describe the act of sleeping. For example, "I'm going to sleep now" (지금 자러 갈 거예요).
