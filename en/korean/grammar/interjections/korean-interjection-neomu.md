Neomu (너무) is a common interjection in Korean that has many different meanings depending on the context of the conversation. It is often used to express extreme emotions, whether they be positive or negative. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the different meanings of neomu and how it can be used in everyday conversation.

## Neomu as "Too Much"

One of the most common uses of neomu is to express the idea of “too much” or “excessively”. For example, if someone has eaten too much food, they might say “neomu meokgi sseoyo” (너무 먹기 써요) which translates to “I’ve eaten too much”. Another example could be “neomu bappayo” (너무 밥파요) which means “I’m excessively hungry”. 

## Neomu as "Very"

Neomu can also be used as a modifier to intensify an adjective, similar to the English word “very”. For instance, if someone says “neomu yeppeoyo” (너무 예뻐요), it means “you’re very pretty”. Another example of using neomu as “very” is “neomu johayo” (너무 좋아요), which means “it’s really good”.

## Neomu as a Stand-Alone Exclamation

Sometimes, people use neomu as an exclamation of excitement or surprise all on its own. This usage is not tied to any specific meaning and its interpretation can depend on the context. For instance, a person might say “neomu!” (너무!) after seeing something amazing or while experiencing a sudden realization.

## Conclusion

Neomu is an extremely versatile interjection. Whether to express excitement, shock or to describe an abundance of something, including neomu in a conversation can make it sound more natural and engaging for native Korean speakers. By using neomu appropriately, non-Korean speakers can display a better understanding of the Korean language and its nuances.
