Korean language is full of vibrant expressions and interjections that convey different emotions and tones. One such interjection is "-요" (-yo), which is widely used in Korean conversation. It is a suffix that is added at the end of a sentence, and its usage depends on the context and the speaker's relationship with the listener. 

## Usage of -요 (-yo)

### Politeness Marker

The most common usage of "-요" (-yo) in Korean is as a politeness marker. When added at the end of a sentence, it makes the sentence polite and respectful. It is used to show respect to someone who is elder or senior in rank or position. For example: 

- 안녕하세요 (annyeonghaseyo) - Hello (formal)
- 맛있어요 (masisseoyo) - It's delicious. (formal)

In the above examples, "-요" (-yo) has been added to make the sentences respectful and polite.

### Softener

Another usage of "-요" (-yo) is as a softener in conversation. It is used to make a statement sound less firm or authoritative. For example:

- 나 살짝 피곤해요 (na saljjak pigonhaeyo) - I am a bit tired. (softened version)
- 나 살짝 피곤해 (na saljjak pigonhae) - I am a bit tired. (firm version)

In the first example, the sentence has been softened by adding "-요" (-yo) at the end, making it sound less authoritative and more polite.

### Emphasis

"-요" (-yo) can also be used to emphasize a statement or question. It is added at the end of the sentence to give it more emphasis, especially when the speaker wants to make a point or ask a question more strongly. For example:

- 제가 제일 좋아하는 음식은 떡볶이예요 (jega jeil johahaneun eumsigeun tteokbokkiyeyo) - My favorite food is tteokbokki. (emphasized version)
- 뭐요? (mwoyo?) - What did you say? (emphasized question)

In the above examples, "-요" (-yo) has been added to put more emphasis on the statement or question.
