Korean language is renowned for its complex and intricate grammar rules. One of the most important aspects of Korean grammar is the use of subordinating conjunctions. These conjunctions are the glue that holds sentences together and allows complex thoughts to be communicated effectively.

Subordinating conjunctions are words that join dependent clauses to independent clauses. They are used to show the relationship between the two clauses, such as cause and effect or time sequence. In Korean, there are many subordinating conjunctions that serve different functions.

Here are some of the most common Korean subordinating conjunctions:

### -때문에 (-ttaemune)

This conjunction translates to "because of" or "due to." It is used to show the cause and effect relationship between two clauses. 

Example: 비가 오니까 우산을 가져와. (Biga onikka usaneul gajyeowa.) - Bring an umbrella because it's raining.

### -고 (-go)

This conjunction translates to "and" or "while." It is used to show that two actions are happening at the same time. 

Example: 나는 책을 읽고 공부해. (Naneun chaeg-eul ilko gongbuhae.) - I read a book and study.

### -아/어서 (-a/eoseo)

This conjunction translates to "so" or "therefore." It is used to show the result of an action in the previous clause. 

Example: 일찍 일어나서 학교에 늦지 않게 가려고 해. (Iljjik ireonaseo haggyoe neujji anke garyeogo hae.) - I wake up early so I won't be late for school.

### -기 때문에 (-gi ttaemune)

This conjunction translates to "because" or "since." It is used to show the reason for an action in the previous clause. 

Example: 시험에 잘 보기 때문에 매일 밤 공부한다. (Sihome jal bogi ttaemune maeil bam gongbuhanda.) - I study every night since I want to do well on the test.

### -면 (-myeon)

This conjunction translates to "if" or "when." It is used to show a condition that must be met for the action in the second clause to occur. 

Example: 시간이 되면 불러줘. (Sigani doemyeon bulleojwo.) - Call me when it's time.

### -다가 (-daga)

This conjunction translates to "while" or "as." It is used to show that two actions occur simultaneously or consecutively. 

Example: 나는 음악을 들으면서 자주 노래를 한다. (Naneun eumak-eul deureumyeonseo jaju noraereul handa.) - I often sing songs while listening to music.

### -지만 (-jiman)

This conjunction translates to "but" or "however." It is used to introduce a contrasting idea to the previous clause. 

Example: 나는 밥을 잘 먹는데, 저녁에는 항상 배가 고프다. (Naneun bab-eul jal meongneunde, jeonyeogeun hangsang baega gopuda.) - I eat well, but I'm always hungry at night.
