# Korean Correlative Conjunctions: Usage and Types

Correlative conjunctions are an essential part of the Korean language, as they connect two related ideas or phrases. They are used to show a relationship between two things or to express contrast. In this article, we will go over the usage and types of Korean correlative conjunctions.

## Usage of Korean Correlative Conjunctions

Korean correlative conjunctions are used to connect two related ideas in a sentence. The first phrase is typically followed by the conjunction, which is then followed by the second phrase. These conjunctions provide a sense of unity to a sentence and give it a smooth flow.

## Types of Korean Correlative Conjunctions

Here are some of the most common types of Korean correlative conjunctions:

### 같이...하다/같이...해요

The correlative conjunction 같이...하다/같이...해요 is used to show that two actions are done together. The first phrase is followed by 같이 (together), which is then followed by the second phrase. Here's an example:

- 저는 친구와 같이 밥을 먹었어요. (I ate with my friend.)

### 이제...하지만/하지만 이제

이제...하지만/하지만 이제 is used to express a contrast between two ideas in a sentence. The phrase 이제 (now) is followed by either 하지만 (however) or 때문에 (because) to create a contrast. Here's an example:

- 이제 집에 갈 시간이에요. 하지만 일이 끝나면 다시 와요. (It's time to go home now. However, I will come back after work is done.)

### 기쁘게...슬퍼하게

This correlative conjunction is used to express contrasting emotions. The phrase 기쁘게 (happily) is followed by 슬퍼하게 (sadly) to show a contrast between two emotions. Here's an example:

- 그는 기쁘게 축제에 참여했지만, 슬퍼하게 친구를 떠나야 했어요. (He participated in the festival happily, but sadly had to leave his friend.)

### 그리고...하지만

This correlative conjunction is used to express a combination of ideas that are related but contrast each other. The phrase 그리고 (and) is followed by 하지만 (however) to show a contrast between two ideas. Here's an example:

- 제가 학교에서 배웠던 것들은 노력을 해서 좋은 일자리를 얻을 수 있다는 것이에요. 그리고, 일자리를 얻은 후에는 하지만 일을 잘해야 잘 유지될 수 있어요. (What I learned at school is that you can get a good job with hard work. And after you get a job, however, you need to do well to maintain it.)

### 그래서...그런데

These two conjunctions are used to show a relationship between cause and effect in a sentence. The word 그래서 (so) is followed by 그런데 (however) to show a contrast between two ideas. Here's an example:

- 운전을 못하겠어서 차 없이 살았어요. 그래서, 대중교통을 이용하면서 불편했어요. 그런데, 지금은 능숙하게 운전할 수 있어서 좋아요. (I lived without a car because I couldn't drive. So, I had to use public transportation, which was inconvenient. However, I can drive skilfully now, and that's great.)
