Korean frequency adverbs are used to indicate how often an action is done. In this article, we will go over the most commonly used Korean frequency adverbs and how to use them properly.

## 1. 자주 (jaju) - Often

The most commonly used Korean frequency adverb is 자주 (jaju). It indicates a frequent occurrence of the action. For example:

- 저는 자주 영화를 보러 갑니다. (I often go to watch movies.)

## 2. 가끔 (gakkeum) - Sometimes

가끔 (gakkeum) indicates that the action is done occasionally. For example:

- 제가 가끔 친구를 만나러 갑니다. (I sometimes meet my friends.)

## 3. 때때로 (ttaettaero) - From time to time

때때로 (ttaettaero) has a similar meaning to 가끔 (gakkeum), but it implies a more regular occurrence of the action. For example:

- 그는 때때로 작업을 중단합니다. (He stops working from time to time.)

## 4. 보통 (botong) - Usually

보통 (botong) is used to describe an action that is done on average, or most of the time. For example:

- 그녀는 보통 아침에 운동합니다. (She usually exercises in the morning.)

## 5. 거의 (geo-eui) - Almost

거의 (geo-eui) implies that the action is done almost all the time. For example:

- 나는 거의 매일 학교에 갑니다. (I almost go to school every day.)

## 6. 전혀 (jeonhyeo) - Never

The final Korean frequency adverb on this list is 전혀 (jeonhyeo), which means never. For example:

- 그녀는 전혀 운동하지 않습니다. (She never exercises.)

It's important to note that while these are the most commonly used Korean frequency adverbs, there are many more out there. Additionally, keep in mind that the adverb may take a different form depending on the verb tense being used.

Overall, Korean frequency adverbs are an important part of the language and can help you communicate more accurately and effectively. With practice and attention to context, using these adverbs will become second nature in your Korean speaking and writing.
