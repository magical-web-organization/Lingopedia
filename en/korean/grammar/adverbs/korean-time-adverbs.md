## Introduction

The Korean language is renowned for its complex system of speech levels and honorifics, but did you know that it also has a particular set of adverbs that pertain to time? These time adverbs are critical elements of the Korean language, as they help learners understand the nuances and the context of the conversation.

In this article, we'll dive deeper into the various types of Korean time adverbs and explore how they are used in everyday communication.

## Korean Time Adverbs

### Tense Adverbs

Tense adverbs in Korean typically denote a specific time frame in the past, present, or future. Some examples include:

- 오늘 (oneul) - today
- 어제 (eoje) - yesterday
- 내일 (naeil) - tomorrow
- 이번 주 (ibeon ju) - this week
- 지난 주 (jinan ju) - last week
- 다음 주 (daeum ju) - next week

These adverbs are typically placed at the beginning of a sentence to provide a temporal context to the conversation.

### Duration Adverbs

Duration adverbs, on the other hand, specify how long an action or an event took place. Common examples of Korean duration adverbs include:

- 항상 (hangsang) - always
- 종종 (jongjong) - occasionally
- 자주 (jaju) - often
- 한참 (hancham) - a while
- 얼마 동안 (eolma dong-an) - how long

Duration adverbs can take on different forms depending on the sentence's structure and the tense in which they are being used.

### Frequency Adverbs

Frequency adverbs are used to denote how often an action or an event takes place. In Korean, some commonly used frequency adverbs include:

- 매일 (maeil) - every day
- 보통 (botong) - usually
- 가끔 (gakkeum) - sometimes
- 자주 (jaju) - often
- 한 번 (han beon) - once

Frequency adverbs are often placed directly before the verb they are modifying.

### Time-specific Adverbs

Lastly, time-specific adverbs refer to a precise time or date. Examples include:

- 12시 30분 (yeolsi samship bun) - 12:30
- 5월 1일 (owol iril) - May 1st
- 크리스마스 (keuriseumaseu) - Christmas
- 필리핀 여행 (pillipin yeohaeng) - Philippines trip
- 저녁 6시 (jeonyeok yuk-si) - 6 pm

Time-specific adverbs are usually placed at the beginning of a sentence.
