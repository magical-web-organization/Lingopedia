Korean language is known for its polite and logical structure. Korean pronouns are an essential part of Korean grammar. In the Korean language, demonstrative pronouns indicate the location and the distance of the object from the speaker and the listener. Understanding Korean demonstrative pronouns is essential to convey the meaning effectively in the Korean language.

Korean demonstrative pronouns fall into two categories; this/ these and that/ those. In Korean, "이" and "이것" indicate "this" and "these," while "저" and "저것" indicate "that" and "those." 

# 이 and 이것 (This and These)

The word "이" is used as a pronoun, which means "this" in English. When you want to indicate something that is near to the speaker or the listener, you can use 이. 

For example: 

- 이것을 좀 빌려줄 수 있으세요? (Can you lend me this?)
- 이거 한번 볼래? (Do you want to see this one?)
- 이것은 뭐예요? (What's this?) 

The word "이것" means "this" in English and refers to a noun that is close to the speaker or listener. When you want to describe something specific, you can use 이것.

For example: 

- 이것은 내 컴퓨터야. (This is my computer.)
- 이것 맛있어 보이는데 한번 맛볼까? (This looks delicious. Do you want to try it?)
- 이것 좀 봐봐. 참 신기하다. (Look at this. It's amazing.)

# 저 and 저것 (That and Those)

The word "저," used as a pronoun, means "that" in English. When you want to point out something that is far from the speaker or the listener, you can use 저.

For example: 

- 그건 좀 더 갈 것 같아요. (I think that will take longer to get there.)
- 저는 그 영화를 본 적이 없어요. (I have never seen that movie before.)
- 그것은 내가 지난 여름에 산 것이에요. (That's something I bought last summer.)

The word "저것" means "that" in English and refers to a noun that is far from the speaker or listener. When you want to describe something specific, you can use 저것.

For example: 

- 저것은 우리 학교 건물이에요. (That's our school building.)
- 저것 좀 보여줘. 뭐야 그거? (Show me that. What is it?)
- 그 사람 저것하고 무슨 관계에요? (What's the relationship between that person and that thing?)
