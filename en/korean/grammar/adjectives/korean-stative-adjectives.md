Korean language is rich in adjectives, and among them are the stative adjectives. These are adjectives that describe the state or condition of something or someone. They are different from action verbs that describe actions or activities performed by the subject.

In Korean grammar, stative adjectives are called "상태 형용사 (sangtae hyeongyongsa)." They are characterized by their ending "-ㄴ/은," which is added to the stem of descriptive verbs. Stative adjectives, like descriptive verbs, are used in the predicate position in sentences.

Here are some examples of stative adjectives and their descriptive verb forms:

- 높다 (notta) - to be high/tall - 높은 (notteun) - high/tall
- 작다 (jakda) - to be small - 작은 (jakkeun) - small
- 예쁘다 (yeppeuda) - to be pretty - 예쁜 (yeppeun) - pretty
- 강하다 (kanghada) - to be strong - 강한 (kanghan) - strong
- 더럽다 (deoreobda) - to be dirty - 더러운 (deoreoun) - dirty

In sentences, stative adjectives are used to describe the subject's state or condition. For example:

- 나무는 높다. (Namuneun notta.) - The tree is tall.
- 그 사람은 작다. (Geu saram-eun jakda.) - That person is small.
- 그 여자는 예쁘다. (Geu yeoja-neun yeppeuda.) - That woman is pretty.
- 우리 아버지는 강하다. (Uri abeoji-neun kanghada.) - Our father is strong.
- 방이 더러워요. (Bang-i deoreowoyo.) - The room is dirty.

Note that the subject is followed by the particle "-는 (neun)" before the stative adjective, and the predicate-adjective is followed by the verb or ending "-이다 (ida)." However, in spoken Korean, the verb or "-이다 (ida)" can be shortened to "-야 (ya)" or "-이야 (iya)."

In summary, stative adjectives are a type of adjective used to describe a subject's state or condition. They are formed by adding "-ㄴ/은 (neun)" to the stem of descriptive verbs. They are used in the predicate position in sentences, and often accompanied by the particle "-는 (neun)" and verb or ending "-이다 (ida)." Knowing how to use stative adjectives can greatly improve your Korean language and communication skills.
