Korean location particles, also known as 위치 조사 (wichi josa), are essential to master when learning Korean as they help indicate the location of an object or person in a sentence. There are four location particles in Korean: 에/에게, 에서, 에서부터, and 까지. In this article, we will delve deeper into each of these particles and understand how they are used in sentences.

### 에/에게 (e/e-ge)

에/에게 is used to indicate the destination or direction of movement. If someone is going to a specific location or heading in a particular direction, this particle is used. For example:

- 학교에 가고 있어요. (Hakgyo-e gago isseoyo.) - I am going to school.
- 집에 오세요. (Jip-e oseyo.) - Please come to my house.

It is important to note that 에게 is used when the location is a person, and 에 is used when the location is an object.

### 에서 (eseo)

에서 is used to indicate a location where an action is taking place. It is used with verbs that involve actions, movements, or occurrences. For example:

- 영화관에서 영화를 봤어요. (Yeonghwagwan-eseo yeonghwa-reul bwasseoyo.) - I watched a movie at the cinema.
- 친구들과 공원에서 놀고 있어요. (Chingudeul-gwa gongwon-eseo nolgo isseoyo.) - I am hanging out with friends at the park.

### 에서부터 (eseo-buteo)

에서부터 is used to indicate a starting point of movement or action. It is often used with time-related expressions to indicate the starting time. For example:

- 개학식은 오전 10시에서부터 시작합니다. (Gaehaksigeun ojeon shi-eseo-buteo shijakamnida.) - The school opening ceremony starts from 10 am.
- 점심시간은 12시 30분에서부터 1시 30분까지입니다. (Jeomsimsigan-eun yeolshib-i bun-eseo-buteo il-si-sib-bun-kkajiibnida.) - Lunchtime is from 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm.

### 까지 (kkaji)

까지 is used to indicate the end point of movement or action. It is also used with time-related expressions to indicate the end time. For example:

- 열차가 서울역까지 오고 있어요. (Yeolchaga seoulyeok-kkaji ogo isseoyo.) - The train is heading towards Seoul Station.
- 오늘은 6시까지 일해야 해요. (Oneureun yookshi-kkaji ilhaeya haeyo.) - I have to work until 6 pm today.

In conclusion, if you want to convey the location of an object or person in a sentence, you need to use the appropriate location particle in Korean. Get familiar with the different particles and practice using them in sentences to master the language.
