The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters, written from right to left, that are used to write several languages including Arabic, Urdu, Persian, and Pashto. Each letter has a distinct shape and pronunciation, making it essential to understand the basics of the Arabic alphabet before studying the language.

## Basics of the Arabic Alphabet

The Arabic alphabet has three letters that have no English equivalent sound, including:

* The letter Ain (ع)
* The letter Ghayn (غ)
* The letter Qaf (ق)

It is essential to practice the pronunciation of these letters to acquire the correct accent and achieve better communication skills.

Moreover, the Arabic alphabet has two basic forms: the isolated form and the connected form. The isolated form is used when the letter appears alone, and the connected form is used when the letter connects with other letters.
