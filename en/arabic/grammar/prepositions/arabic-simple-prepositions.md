Arabic, like several other languages, makes use of prepositions to connect different elements of a sentence. Prepositions are essential in Arabic grammar, and there are two kinds of prepositions in Arabic: simple and compound. In this article, we'll be discussing Arabic simple prepositions.

### What are Arabic Simple Prepositions?

Simple prepositions, as the name suggests, are single units of sound or letters that form a word and are used to link the different parts of a sentence. Arabic simple prepositions are often used to show the location, time, or direction in a sentence. Simple prepositions in Arabic do not change their form even if they are used in different parts of speech.
