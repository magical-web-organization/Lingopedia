# Arabic Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns are used to show ownership or possession of a noun by a person or a group of persons. In the Arabic language, possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession or ownership of a noun without mentioning it specifically.

## Singular Possessive Pronouns

The singular possessive pronouns in Arabic are as follows:

| Person   | Pronoun |
| -------- | ------- |
| First    | يَــــا (ya)  |
| Second   | كَــــــ(ka)  |
| Third    | هُوَ / هِــــيَ (huwa/hiya) |

We use these singular possessive pronouns before the noun to show who it belongs to. For example:

- يَا كِتَاب‌​ُيَ (ya kitaabi) – my book
- كَتَاب‌ُكَ (kitaabuka) – your book
- كِتَابُهُ (kitaabuhu) – his book

## Dual Possessive Pronouns

The dual possessive pronouns in Arabic are as follows:

| Person   | Pronoun |
| -------- | ------- |
| First    | نَــــا (na)  |
| Second   | كُــــمَا (kumaa)  |
| Third    | هُــمَا (huma) |

We use these dual possessive pronouns before the noun to show who it belongs to. For example:

- نَا حَقِيبَتَانِ (na haqeebatani) – our two bags
- حَقِيبَتَانِكُمَا (haqeebatanikumaa) – your two bags
- حَقِيبَتَاهُمَا (haqeebatahumaa) – their two bags

## Plural Possessive Pronouns

The plural possessive pronouns in Arabic are as follows:

| Person   | Pronoun |
| -------- | ------- |
| First    | نَـــا (na)  |
| Second   | كُـــمْ (kum)  |
| Third    | هُــمْ (hum) |

We use these plural possessive pronouns before the noun to show who it belongs to. For example:

- نَا كُتُبِنَا (na kutubina) – our books
- كُتُبُكُمْ (kutubukum) – your books
- كُتُبُهُمْ (kutubuhum) – their books
