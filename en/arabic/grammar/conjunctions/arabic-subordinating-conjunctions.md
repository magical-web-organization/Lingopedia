These conjunctions are often used when constructing complex sentences. In this article, we will explore some common Arabic subordinating conjunctions and how they are used.

## إِذَا

The subordinating conjunction إِذَا (itha) is often used to introduce a dependent clause that describes a hypothetical or conditional situation. This conjunction can also be used to express a future action or event. Some examples of sentences using إِذَا include:
