Arabic is a Semitic language that has over 10,000 verbs. It is a complex language with intricate grammar and a distinctive vocabulary. Understanding the Arabic verb system is essential for mastering the language. In this article, we will explore the various forms and tenses of Arabic verbs.

### Basic Structure of Arabic Verbs

Arabic verbs consist of three main parts: the root or base verb, the pattern, and the tense. Every Arabic verb is based on a three or four-consonant root. The pattern refers to the way the verb changes depending on the tense and the subject. Verbs change based on who is performing the action and when the action happens.

The verbs are divided into two categories: regular verbs and irregular verbs. Irregular verbs do not follow the standard patterns, making them more difficult to conjugate.

### The 10 Arabic Verb Forms

Arabic verbs follow a variety of patterns, known as the ten verb forms. Each of the ten verb forms has its own unique conjugation. The first three verb forms are the most common:

**Verb Form I** - this is the simplest verb form and is used to form the present tense. It consists of the root and the pattern: faʿala (فَعَلَ).

**Verb Form II** - this form is commonly used to form the past tense. It consists of the root, the pattern, and a prefix ta- or an-:tafʿala (تَفْعَلَ) or anfʿala (أَنْفَعَلَ).

**Verb Form III** - this form is used to form the future tense. It consists of the root, the pattern, and a suffix sa-:safʿala (سَفْعَلَ).

The remaining verb forms are used less frequently, but they can still be found in both modern and classical Arabic. 

### Tenses of Arabic Verbs

Arabic verbs can be conjugated in four tenses: present, past, future, and imperative.

**Present Tense** - the present tense is used to indicate an action that is currently happening or is generally true. To form the present tense, add the appropriate prefix and suffix to the root word.

Example: The present tense of kataba (to write) is:

أَنا أَكْتُبُ (I write)
أَنْتَ تَكْتُبُ (You write, masculine singular)
أَنْتِ تَكْتُبِينَ (You write, feminine singular)
هُوَ يَكْتُبُ (He writes)
هِيَ تَكْتُبُ (She writes)
نَحْنُ نَكْتُبُ (We write)
أَنْتُمْ تَكْتُبُونَ (You all write, masculine plural)
أَنْتُنَّ تَكْتُبْنَ (You all write, feminine plural)
هُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ (They write, masculine or mixed gender)
هُنَّ يَكْتُبْنَ (They write, feminine)

**Past Tense** - the past tense is used to describe an action that has already happened. To form the past tense, the prefix ta- or an- is added to the Form II pattern.

Example: The past tense of kataba (to write) is:

أَنا كَتَبْتُ (I wrote)
أَنْتَ كَتَبْتَ (You wrote, masculine singular)
أَنْتِ كَتَبْتِ (You wrote, feminine singular)
هُوَ كَتَبَ (He wrote)
هِيَ كَتَبَتْ (She wrote)
نَحْنُ كَتَبْنَا (We wrote)
أَنْتُمْ كَتَبْتُمْ (You all wrote, masculine plural)
أَنْتُنَّ كَتَبْتُنَّ (You all wrote, feminine plural)
هُمْ كَتَبُوا (They wrote, masculine or mixed gender)
هُنَّ كَتَبْنَ (They wrote, feminine)

**Future Tense** - the future tense is used to describe an action that will happen in the future. The Form III pattern is used for the future tense.

Example: The future tense of kataba (to write) is:

أَنا سَأَكْتُبُ (I will write)
أَنْتَ سَتَكْتُبُ (You will write, masculine singular)
أَنْتِ سَتَكْتُبِينَ (You will write, feminine singular)
هُوَ سَيَكْتُبُ (He will write)
هِيَ سَتَكْتُبُ (She will write)
نَحْنُ سَنَكْتُبُ (We will write)
أَنْتُمْ سَتَكْتُبُونَ (You all will write, masculine plural)
أَنْتُنَّ سَتَكْتُبْنَ (You all will write, feminine plural)
هُمْ سَيَكْتُبُونَ (They will write, masculine or mixed gender)
هُنَّ سَيَكْتُبْنَ (They will write, feminine)

**Imperative Tense** - the imperative tense is used to give commands or orders. The Form II pattern is used for the imperative tense.

Example: The imperative tense of kataba (to write) is:

أَكْتُبْ (Write!, masculine singular)
أَكْتُبِي (Write!, feminine singular)
كَتَبُوا (Write!, masculine or mixed gender plural)
كَتَبْنَ (Write!, feminine plural)
