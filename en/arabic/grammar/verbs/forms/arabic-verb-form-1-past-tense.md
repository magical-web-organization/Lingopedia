Arabic is a beautiful language with intricate grammar rules and verb forms. One of the most common verb forms in Arabic is Verb Form 1, also known as the Past Tense (أَفْعَلَ). This verb form is used to indicate an action that has already occurred in the past. In this article, we will explore the structure, conjugation, and examples of Verb Form 1.

## Structure

The structure of Verb Form 1 is straightforward. The base form of the verb is made up of three letters – a consonant, a vowel, and another consonant. For example, the word "كَتَبَ" (kataba) means "he wrote" and is made up of the consonants "k," "t," and "b." To conjugate the verb in the past tense, we add certain prefixes and suffixes to the base form depending on the subject of the sentence.

## Conjugation

The conjugation of Verb Form 1 in the past tense is as follows:

| Subject Pronoun | Prefix | Suffix | Example |
|-----------------|--------|--------|---------|
| I               | كُنْتُ  | -تُ     | كُنْتُ أَكْتُبُ (kuntu aktubu) - I was writing |
| You (masc.)     | كُنْتَ  | -تَ     | كُنْتَ تَكْتُبُ (kunta taktubu) - You were writing |
| You (fem.)      | كُنْتِ  | -تِ     | كُنْتِ تَكْتُبِينَ (kunti taktubina) - You were writing |
| He/She/It       | كَانَ  | -َ      | كَانَ يَكْتُبُ (kana yaktubu) - He was writing |
| We              | كُنَّا  | -نَا    | كُنَّا نَكْتُبُ (kunna naktubu) - We were writing |
| You (pl.)       | كُنْتُم | -تُمْ   | كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُبُونَ (kuntum taktubuna) - You were writing |
| They            | كَانُوا | -ُوا    | كَانُوا يَكْتُبُونَ (kanu yaktubuna) - They were writing |

Note: The subject pronouns are necessary to indicate who is performing the action in the sentence. They are often omitted in conversational Arabic, as the verb itself indicates the subject.

## Examples

Here are some examples of Verb Form 1 in the past tense:

- كَتَبْتُ رِسَالَةً (katabtu risaalatan) - I wrote a letter.
- كَانَتْ هِيَ تَشْرَبُ الْقَهْوَةَ (kaanat hiya tashrabu alqahwah) - She used to drink coffee.
- كُنَّا نُذَاكِرُ لِاِمْتِحَانِ اللُّغَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ (kunna nudhaakiru limtihaani allughah alarabiyyah) - We were studying for the Arabic language exam.
