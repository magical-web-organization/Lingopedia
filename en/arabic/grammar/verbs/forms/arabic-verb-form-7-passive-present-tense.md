Arabic verb form 7, also known as افْعَلَّ in Arabic, refers to the passive present tense. In this article, we will explain what the passive present tense is, how to form it, and give examples of how it is used in Arabic sentences.

## What is the Passive Present Tense?

The passive present tense is a type of verb conjugation where the subject of the sentence is not the doer of the action. Rather, the subject is the recipient of the action. In other words, the sentence is passive, which means that the focus is on the action being done to the subject rather than the subject doing the action.

In Arabic, the passive present tense is formed by adding certain letters to the base form of the verb. This creates a new verb form that is used to express the passive voice in the present tense. 

## Forming the Passive Present Tense in Arabic

To form the passive present tense in Arabic, we follow a specific formula. The formula for forming the passive present tense is as follows:

1. Take the present tense base, which is usually the third-person masculine singular form of the verb (e.g., fa'ala - فَعَلَ).
2. Add the letters أَفْعَلُ (af'alu) to the base form of the verb.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to form the passive present tense in Arabic:

- قَطَّعَ (qaTTa'a) - to cut. Passive present tense: يُقَطَّعُ (yuqaTTa'u).
- سَمِعَ (sami'a) - to hear. Passive present tense: يُسْمَعُ (yusma'u).
- دَرَسَ (darasa) - to study. Passive present tense: يُدْرَسُ (yudrasu).

## Usage of the Passive Present Tense

The passive present tense in Arabic is used in a variety of situations. The most common usage is to describe actions that are done to the subject. For example:

- البَابُ يُغْلَقُ. (al-baabu yughlaqu) - The door is closed.
- السُّؤَالُ يُجِيبُ. (as-su'aalu yujeebu) - The question is answered.
- الدَّرْسُ يُدْرَسُ. (ad-darsu yudrasu) - The lesson is studied.

Another common usage of the passive present tense is to avoid blaming or identifying the doer of the action. For example:

- تُكْتَبُ هَذِهِ الرِّسَالَةُ بِاللُّغَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ. (tuktabu hadhihi ar-risaalatu bil-lugati al-'arabiyyah) - This letter is written in Arabic.
- يُحْضَرُ السَّفَرَةُ. (yuHdaru as-safaratu) - The table is set.
