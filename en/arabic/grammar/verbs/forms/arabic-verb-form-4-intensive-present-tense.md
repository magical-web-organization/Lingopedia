# Arabic Verb Form 4: Intensive Present Tense (أَفْعَلَّ)

Arabic is a rich and complex language with numerous verb forms. One of the most important verb forms in Arabic is the intensive present tense, which is known as Form 4 or أَفْعَلَّ. The intensive present tense is used to describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or habitual.

In this article, we will discuss the Arabic verb form 4 intensive present tense and how to conjugate it.

## Conjugating the Intensive Present Tense

The intensive present tense is formed by adding the letters أَفْ to the beginning of the verb, and then conjugating the verb in the present tense. Let's take the verb "to write" (كَتَبَ) as an example:

| Person | Conjugated Verb |
| ------ | -------------- |
| I      | أَكْتُبُ       |
| You (M) | تَكْتُبُ       |
| You (F) | تَكْتُبِينَ    |
| He/She | يَكْتُبُ       |
| We     | نَكْتُبُ       |
| You     | تَكْتُبُونَ    |
| They   | يَكْتُبُونَ    |

As you can see, the intensive present tense adds the letter أَفْ to the beginning of the verb, and then conjugates it in the present tense.

It's important to note that not all verbs can be conjugated in the intensive present tense. Only verbs that have three consonants (triliteral) can be conjugated in this way.

## Usage of the Intensive Present Tense

The intensive present tense is used to describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or habitual. For example, if we want to say "I write every day", we would use the intensive present tense:

أَكْتُبُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ

If we wanted to say "He sleeps a lot", we would use the intensive present tense:

يَنْامُ كَثِيرًا

The intensive present tense is also used when expressing a state or condition, such as "I am tired":

أَكْتُبُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ
