Arabic verb form 6, also known as the intensive reflexive present tense, is a common form of verb conjugation in the Arabic language. In this form, the performer of the action is typically doing it to themselves, and the verb is usually formed by adding the letters تَفَعَّلَ to the basic root of the verb.

For example, if the root of the verb is خَسِرَ (to lose), the intensive reflexive form would be formed as تَخَسَّرَ, which translates to "to lose oneself" or "to incur a loss on oneself".

To conjugate Arabic verb form 6, one must follow a specific pattern. The following is an example of the verb كَتَبَ (to write) in the intensive reflexive present tense:

| Person | Pronoun | Conjugation |
| ------ | ------- | -----------|
| 1st    | أَنَا   | أَكْتَبُّ |
| 2nd M  | أَنْتَ  | تَكْتَبُّ |
| 2nd F  | أَنْتِ  | تَكْتَبِينَّ |
| 3rd M  | هُوَ   | يَكْتَبُ   |
| 3rd F  | هِيَ   | تَكْتَبُ   |
| 1st P  | نَحْنُ  | نَكْتَبُ   |
| 2nd P  | أَنْتُمْ | تَكْتَبُونَ |
| 3rd P  | هُمْ   | يَكْتَبُونَ|

As demonstrated in the table above, the root letters are kept, and the pattern تَفَعَّلَ is added to the end. The shadda (ّ) on the second letter of the root, which doubles the letter, is a unique feature of this form.

The intensive reflexive form is used in a variety of contexts, including when the performer of the action is the only one affected. For example, يَتَكَلَّمُ عَنِ النَّفْسِ (he speaks about himself) uses the intensive reflexive form because the speaker is referring to himself only.

Another example can be found in the following sentence: تَسْتَخِدُّ الشَّرِكَةُ بِالْقَدْرَةِ الْعِلْمِيَّةِ لِلْعَامِلِينَ (the company uses the workers' scientific abilities). Here, the intensive reflexive form is used because the workers are using their abilities on behalf of the company.

In conclusion, Arabic verb form 6, or the intensive reflexive present tense, is a crucial aspect of Arabic grammar, and its mastery is critical to becoming proficient in the language. As with anything in Arabic, practice makes perfect, and continued usage and exposure to this form will eventually lead to mastery.
