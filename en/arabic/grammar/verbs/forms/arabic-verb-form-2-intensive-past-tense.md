# Arabic Verb Form 2: Intensive Past Tense (فَعَّلَ)

Arabic grammar can be complicated, but it’s important to learn for better communication and understanding. One aspect of Arabic grammar is verb forms, which communicate various aspects of the verb’s action. Here we’ll focus on Arabic Verb Form 2: intensive past tense (فَعَّلَ).

## What is Verb Form 2?

Verb Form 2 is a common Arabic verb form that is used to signal intensity of a verb’s past tense action. It is formed by adding the letters فَعَّلَ to the root verb’s three letter stem.

Here’s an example: The verb root قَطَعَ (qaṭaʿa) means “to cut.” To add intensity to the past tense form of this verb, one would take the فَعَّلَ and add it to the root stem.

The past tense form becomes فَقَّطَعَ (faqqaṭaʿa), which means “he cut intensely.”

## Using Verb Form 2

In Arabic writing and speech, the use of Verb Form 2 signals an extra layer of intensity beyond what is conveyed by the root verb’s past tense form. This intensity could convey urgency, emphasis, or drama.

Here are a few examples:

- رَأَيْتُ الكِتَابَ. (Raʾaytu alkitāb.) – “I saw the book.”
- فَرَأَيْتُ الكِتَابَ (Farraʾaytu alkitāb.) – “I saw the book intensely.” (implying seeing it with urgency or emphasis)

- قَالَ جَوَادٌ، « ذَهَبْتُ إِلَى الطَّبِيبِ. » (Qāla Jawādun, “Ẓahabtu ilā aṭ-ṭabīb.”) – “Jawad said, ‘I went to the doctor.’”
- فَقَالَ جَوَادٌ، « فَذَهَبْتُ إِلَى الطَّبِيبِ. » (faqāla Jawādun, “faẓahabtu ilā aṭ-ṭabīb.”) – “Jawad said intensely, ‘I went to the doctor.’” (implying some sort of drama or urgency in the situation)

- كَتَبْتُ الرَّسَالَةَ. (Katabtu ar-rasālah.) – “I wrote the letter.”
- فَكَتَبْتُ الرَّسَالَةَ. (fakatabtu ar-rasālah.) – “I wrote the letter intensely.” (implying emphasis or urgency)
