The first verb form is called the "past tense" and is used to describe completed actions in the past. The basic structure of this verb form is فعل, where the root letters F-A-L form the base of the word, and prefixes and suffixes are added to form different meanings. For example, يَعْلَمُ (yaʿlamu) means "he knows."

The basic structure of this verb form is فعّل, where the root letters F-ʿ-L form the base of the word, and prefixes and suffixes are added to form different meanings. For example, يُصَلِّي (yuṣalli) means "he prays repeatedly."

## Verb Form III (فَعِلَ)
