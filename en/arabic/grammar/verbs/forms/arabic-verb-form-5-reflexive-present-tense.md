Arabic verb form 5, also known as the تَفَاعَلَ (tafaa'ala) form, is a reflexive form that is used to indicate that the action of the verb is being performed on oneself. In this article, we will focus on how to conjugate this verb form in the present tense.

To conjugate a verb in the reflexive present tense, you need to add the appropriate prefix to the beginning of the verb, depending on the subject. The prefixes are as follows:

- أَنَا (ana) - أَتَفَاعَلُ (atafaa'alu)
- أَنْتَ (anta) - تَتَفَاعَلُ (tatafaa'alu)
- هُوَ / هِيَ (huwa / hiya) - يَتَفَاعَلُ (yatafaa'alu)
- نَحْنُ (nahnu) - نَتَفَاعَلُ (natafaa'alu)
- أَنْتُمْ (antum) - تَتَفَاعَلُونَ (tatafaa'aluna)
- هُمْ / هُنَّ (hum / hunna) - يَتَفَاعَلُونَ (yatafaa'aluna)

As you can see, the prefix تَ (ta) is added to the base verb, followed by the appropriate subject prefix. For example, to say "I am washing myself", you would say أَنَا أَتَفَاعَلُ (ana atafaa'alu), with the base verb وَسَخَ (wasakha) meaning "to wash".

Here are some more examples of verbs in Arabic verb form 5, conjugated in the reflexive present tense:

- يَحْتَرِقُ (yahtariqu) - to burn (reflexive)
  - أَنْتَ تَحْتَرِقُ (anta tahtariqu) - you are burning yourself
- يُسَافِرُ (yusafiru) - to travel (reflexive)
  - هُمْ يُسَافِرُونَ (hum yusafiruna) - they are traveling themselves
- يَبْكِي (yabki) - to cry (reflexive)
  - نَحْنُ نَبْكِي (nahnu nabki) - we are crying ourselves

In addition to adding the appropriate subject prefix to the verb, you should also make sure to match the subject with the appropriate form of كَانَ (kana) to form the negative and interrogative versions of the present tense. For example:

- أَنْتَ تَحْتَرِقُ، أَلَيْسَ كَذَلِكَ؟ (anta tahtariqu, alaysa kathalika?) - Are you not burning yourself?
- لا أَتَحْتَرِقُ (la atahariqu) - I am not burning myself.

Overall, Arabic verb form 5 is an important reflexive form that allows speakers to talk about actions being performed on themselves. By conjugating verbs in the reflexive present tense, you can express a wide range of actions and concepts in Arabic.
