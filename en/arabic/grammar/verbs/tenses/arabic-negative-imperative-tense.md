The Arabic negative imperative tense is used when one wants to give a command or order in the negative form. It is a type of command that is used to tell someone not to do something. The negative imperative tense is different from the affirmative imperative tense in Arabic, which is used to give positive commands.

Formation of Arabic Negative Imperative Tense

The negative imperative tense is formed by adding the Arabic word "لا" (la) before the present tense verb. The present tense verb will be in its third person masculine singular form. This is the same form used for the masculine past tense. For example, the verb "يَكْتُبُ" (yaktubu) means "he writes". In the negative imperative tense, it becomes "لا يَكْتُبْ" (la yaktub) meaning "don't write".

Usage of Arabic Negative Imperative Tense

The Arabic negative imperative tense is used when one wants to give a command in the negative form. It is a way to tell someone not to do something. It is a common form of communication in Arabic for parents, teachers, and other authority figures when giving instructions or commands to their children or subordinates. 

For example, a teacher might say to a student "لا تَتَأَخَّرْ" (la tata'akhhar) meaning "don't be late". A parent might say to a child "لا تَأْكُلُ الحَلْوَى" (la ta'kul al-halwa) meaning "don't eat candy".

It is important to note that in Arabic, there is no equivalent of the English word "please". A negative imperative is considered polite enough in many situations. However, if one wants to express politeness, one can add the word "من فضلك" which means "please".

Example sentences:

1. لا تدخل الغرفة (la tadkhul alghurfah) – Don't enter the room.
2. لا تتأخر عن العمل (la tata'akhhar 'an al'eaml) – Don't be late for work.
3. لا تلعب بالنار (la til'ab bialnnar) – Don't play with fire.
4. لا تحرك هذا (la taharrak hadha) – Don't move this.
5. لا تتكلم كثيرًا (la tatakallam kathiran) – Don't talk too much.
6. لا تحضر لقاء اليوم (la tahdar liqa' alyawm) – Don't attend the meeting today.
