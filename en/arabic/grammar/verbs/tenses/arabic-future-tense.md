Arabic is a rich and diverse language spoken by millions of people worldwide. As with any language, learning its grammar and syntax is essential for effective communication. One critical aspect of the Arabic language is the future tense, which refers to actions or events that will happen in the future.

In this article, we will discuss everything you need to know about the Arabic future tense, including its conjugation, common uses, and examples.

## Conjugating the Arabic Future Tense##

To form the future tense in Arabic, you need to use the suffix "-َا" (-a) at the end of the verb. This suffix is added to the verb's present tense, which is the base form. For example, the verb "yaktubu" (he writes) becomes "saya kt ubu" (He will write). 

Here are some examples of how to form the future tense in Arabic using common verbs:

- **كتب (kataba)** means 'he wrote.' To form the future tense, you add the suffix "-َا" (-a) to the present tense (ktub). Therefore, 'he will write' is سيكتب (saya kt ubu).
- **يدرس (yadrusu)** means 'he studies.' To form the future tense, you add the suffix "-َا" (-a) to the present tense (yadrus). Therefore, 'he will study' is سيردُس (sayadrusu).
- **جاء (ja'a)** means 'he came.' To form the future tense, you add the suffix "-َا" (-a) to the present tense (ja'a). Therefore, 'he will come' is سيأتي (sa-yaeti).
