Arabic language is a fascinating language with various nuances and intricacies, and one of the fundamental aspects of this language is Adjectives. Adjectives are an essential part of the Arabic language, and understanding their number agreement is crucial for successful communication. In this article, we will discuss the rules of number agreement in Arabic adjectives.

## Number Agreement in Arabic Adjectives

In the Arabic language, adjectives must agree with their noun in gender, number, and definiteness. Here, we will focus on the number agreement; the singular and plural forms of adjectives in Arabic.

### Singular Adjectives

In Arabic, singular adjectives are used to describe or modify singular nouns; thus, singular adjectives have a singular form. In most cases, the Arabic adjective follows the noun.

When an adjective follows a singular noun, it must agree with that noun in gender, number, and definiteness. For example:

- "The big cat" - "Al-qitta al-kabira" - القطة الكبيرة (feminine)
- "The big book" - "Al-Kitab al-kabir" - الكتاب الكبير (masculine)

As shown in the examples above, the adjective (kabira and kabir) agrees with the noun in gender and definiteness.

### Plural Adjectives

In the Arabic language, plural adjectives are used to describe or modify plural nouns; thus, plural adjectives have a plural form. The plural form of an Arabic adjective is the same as the feminine form in most cases.

When an adjective follows a plural noun, it must agree with that noun in gender, number, and definiteness. For example:

- "The big cats" - "Al-qittaat al-kabeerat" - القطط الكبيرات (feminine)
- "The big books" - "Al-Kutub al-kabeerat" - الكتب الكبيرة (feminine)

As shown in the examples above, the adjective (kabeerat) agrees with the noun in gender and definiteness.

### Exceptions

As with most languages, there are some exceptions to these rules. In Arabic, some adjectives that end in -i have a plural form that ends in -iyyin for masculine nouns, and -iyyat for feminine nouns.

For example:

- "The new houses" - "Al-buyut al-jadiidat" - البيوت الجديدة (feminine)
- "The new cars" - "Al-siyaarat al-jadiida" - السيارات الجديدة (feminine)

As shown in the examples above, the adjective (jadiida) ends in -i, but the plural form ends in -iyyat as it modifies feminine nouns.

## Conclusion

Understanding number agreement in Arabic adjectives is an essential aspect of Arabic grammar. Adjectives must agree with their noun in gender, number, and definiteness. Arabic adjectives have a singular and a plural form, where the plural form is often the same as the feminine form. However, some adjectives have exceptions and end in -iyyin and -iyyat in their plural form. With practice, mastering Arabic adjective number agreement will become easier, and it is essential to successful communication.
