Arabic adjectives are an important aspect of the language, and mastering them is essential to becoming fluent. One way to expand your vocabulary and increase your fluency is by learning the basic forms of comparison in Arabic adjectives. In this article, we will explore the different forms of comparison and offer some tips on how to use them correctly.

## Positive Form

The positive form is used to describe a single noun or thing without any comparison to anything else. For example, "The book is big" is a positive statement because it describes the size of the book without making any comparisons to other books. The positive form can be formed by simply placing the adjective after the noun it describes.

```
Example: الكتاب كبير. (Al-kitaabu kabiir) - The book is big.
```

## Comparative Form

The comparative form is used to compare two things or nouns. It is formed by placing the particle "أكثر" (akthar) in front of the adjective. It means "more" in English. Another way to form the comparative form is by placing the adjective between "أكثر" and the noun it describes.

```
Example: الكتاب أكبر من الدفتر. (Al-kitaab akbaru mina ddiftr) - The book is bigger than the notebook.
```

## Superlative Form

The superlative form is used to compare three or more things or nouns. It is formed by placing the particle "أكثر" and the word "من" (min) in front of the adjective. "من" means "than" in English. Another way to form the superlative form is by placing the adjective between the two particles. 

```
Example: الكتاب الأكبر من بين الأشياء الثلاثة. (Al-kitaabu al-akbaru min bayni al-'ashyaa' al-thalaathah) - The book is the biggest among the three things.
```

## Irregular Forms

Some Arabic adjectives have exceptional or irregular forms. For instance, the adjective "good" is "جيد" (jayyid) in its positive form. While in its comparative form it will end with "-تر" (tAR).

```
Example: الدرس أجمل من السابق. (Ad-darsu ajmalu min as-sabiqi) - The lesson is more beautiful than the previous one.
```
