Adverbs of manner are an important part of the Arabic language. They modify the verb and describe how an action is performed. It is important to use adverbs of manner to convey your message effectively and accurately.

In Arabic, adverbs of manner are formed by adding the suffix '-an' to the noun or adjective. For example, the word 'شجاع' (shuja') means 'brave'. To form an adverb of manner from this word, add the suffix '-an' to it to get 'شجاعًا' (shuja'an), which means 'bravely'. Similarly, the word 'بطيئ' (batii') means 'slow'. Adding the suffix '-an' to this word gives 'بطيئًا' (batii'an), which means 'slowly'.

Adverbs of manner can also be formed by adding the suffix '-iyyan' to the noun or adjective. This suffix is used to indicate a state of being. For example, the word 'سعيد' (sa'id) means 'happy'. Adding the '-iyyan' suffix to this word gives 'سعيدًا' (sa'idan), which means 'happily'. Similarly, the word 'حزين' (hazin) means 'sad'. Adding the '-iyyan' suffix to this word gives 'حزينًا' (hazinan), which means 'sadly'.

It is important to note that the suffix '-iyyan' can also be added to adjectives that end with '-ii'. For example, the word 'قريب' (qarib) means 'near'. Adding the suffix '-iyyan' to this word gives 'قريبيًا' (qaribiyyan), which means 'closely'. Similarly, the word 'بعيد' (ba'id) means 'far'. Adding the suffix '-iyyan' to this word gives 'بعيديًا' (ba'idiyyan), which means 'far away'.

When using adverbs of manner in a sentence, they usually come after the verb. For example, the sentence 'أكلت الطعام ببطء' (akaltu at-ta'am bibtii') means 'I ate the food slowly'. The adverb of manner 'bibtii'' comes after the verb 'akaltu' (ate).

In conclusion, adverbs of manner are an important part of the Arabic language. They describe how an action is performed and are formed by adding the suffix '-an' or '-iyyan' to the noun or adjective. When using adverbs of manner in a sentence, they usually come after the verb. Practice using adverbs of manner in your Arabic conversation to improve your language skills.
