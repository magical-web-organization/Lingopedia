French adverbs of frequency are words that describe how often an action occurs. These adverbs can be used to express routine activities or habits. In French, there are four main types of adverbs of frequency, each with its own usage in sentences.

## Types of French Adverbs of Frequency
1. **Toujours** - Always
2. **Souvent** - Often
3. **Parfois** - Sometimes
4. **Rarement** - Rarely

### Toujours
"Toujours" is used when an action occurs all the time or every time. For example:

- Je mange toujours des fruits pour le petit déjeuner. (I always eat fruits for breakfast.)
- Il arrive toujours à l'heure. (He always arrives on time.)
- Elle écoute toujours de la musique en conduisant. (She always listens to music when driving.)

### Souvent
"Souvent" is used when an action occurs frequently or regularly. For example:

- Nous allons souvent au cinéma. (We often go to the cinema.)
- Vous parlez souvent de votre travail. (You often talk about your work.)
- Les enfants jouent souvent dans le parc. (The children often play in the park.)

### Parfois
"Parfois" is used when an action occurs sometimes or occasionally. For example:

- Je vais parfois à la gym après le travail. (I sometimes go to the gym after work.)
- Il mange parfois de la viande rouge. (He sometimes eats red meat.)
- Elle regarde parfois des films d'horreur. (She sometimes watches horror movies.)

### Rarement
"Rarement" is used when an action occurs rarely or almost never. For example:

- Nous voyageons rarement à l'étranger. (We rarely travel abroad.)
- Vous faites rarement des erreurs. (You rarely make mistakes.)
- Les chats dorment rarement plus de 12 heures par jour. (Cats rarely sleep more than 12 hours a day.)

## Placement of French Adverbs of Frequency
In French, adverbs of frequency usually come before the verb in a sentence. For example:

- Elle regarde rarement la télévision. (She rarely watches television.)
- Nous parlons souvent de nos voyages. (We often talk about our travels.)
- Tu vas parfois au restaurant le midi. (You sometimes go to a restaurant for lunch.)

However, if the verb is "être" (to be), the adverb of frequency comes after the verb. For example:

- Je suis toujours en retard. (I am always late.)
- Vous êtes souvent occupé(e)s. (You are often busy.)
- Ils sont parfois bizarres. (They are sometimes weird.)

## Conclusion
Adverbs of frequency are essential in making sentences that convey how often an action occurs. Understanding these adverbs' types and placement in sentences will help you communicate more naturally and fluently in French.
