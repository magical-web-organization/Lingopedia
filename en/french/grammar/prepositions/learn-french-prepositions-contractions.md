# Learn French: Prepositions Contractions

As you progress in your French language studies, one concept that you will come across is preposition contractions. Preposition contractions occur when a preposition is combined with a definite article (le, la, les), indefinite article (un, une, des), or a pronoun (me, te, le, la, nous, vous, les) to create a new word.

In French, preposition contractions are quite common and they are used in everyday speech. Thus, it is important to understand the concept of preposition contractions and how to use them correctly.

## The Logic Behind Preposition Contractions

Preposition contractions were developed in the French language to simplify the language and make it easier to pronounce. Pronouncing a preposition followed by a definite article or a personal pronoun can be quite challenging, especially for non-native French speakers. Hence, the French language experts created preposition contractions to make the language easier to speak.

## Common French Preposition Contractions

There are many French preposition contractions, but some of the most commonly used ones include:

- **À + Le = Au:** Au is used to replace "à le." For example, "Je vais au cinema" (I am going to the cinema).

- **À + Les = Aux:** Aux replaces "à les." For example, "Je vais aux magasins" (I am going to the shops).

- **De + Le = Du:** Du is used instead of "de le." For example, "Je viens du Canada" (I am from Canada).

- **De + Les = Des:** Des replaces "de les." For example, "Je reviens des Etats-Unis" (I am coming back from the United States).

- **En + Le = Au:** Au is used to replace "en le." For example, "Je suis au bureau" (I am at the office).

- **En + Les = Aux:** Aux replaces "en les." For example, "Je suis aux toilettes" (I am in the bathroom).

## Other Important Preposition Contractions

In addition to the above preposition contractions, there are also other important ones, including:

- **Chez + Le = Chez le:** For example, "Je vais chez le médecin" (I am going to the doctor).

- **Chez + Les = Chez les:** For example, "Je vais chez les amis" (I am going to my friends' place).

- **Sur + Le = Sur le:** For example, "Je suis sur le pont" (I am on the bridge).

- **Dans + Le = Dans le:** For example, "Je suis dans le parc" (I am in the park).

## Conclusion

Preposition contractions are important in the French language and they are used in everyday speech. Understanding and using preposition contractions correctly is essential for effective communication in French. With this guide, you should now have a better understanding of the most common preposition contractions and how to use them in context.
