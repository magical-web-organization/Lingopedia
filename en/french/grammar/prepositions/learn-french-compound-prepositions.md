As with any language, prepositions are an important part of French grammar. While simple prepositions are relatively straightforward, compound prepositions can be a little more challenging to master. In this article, we'll explore the basics of compound prepositions in the French language and how to use them correctly.

### What are compound prepositions?

Unlike simple prepositions, which consist of a single word (such as "à", "sur", or "dans"), compound prepositions are made up of two or more words. These words can be prepositions on their own or they can be different parts of speech, such as adverbs or nouns.

The most common examples of compound prepositions in French include:

- En face de
- À côté de
- Au-dessus de
- Au-dessous de
- Au milieu de
- Près de
- Loin de

### How to use compound prepositions in French?

Compound prepositions are used in the same way as simple prepositions, to indicate the relationship between two nouns or pronouns in a sentence.

For example, if you want to say "the book is on the table" in French, you would use the compound preposition "sur" (on) and say "le livre est sur la table". If you wanted to say "the cat is under the chair", you would use the compound preposition "sous" (under) and say "le chat est sous la chaise".

It's important to note that the ending of the compound preposition will change depending on the gender and number of the noun being referred to. For example, if you wanted to say "the glasses are on the counter", you would use the compound preposition "sur" (on) and say "les verres sont sur le comptoir". However, if you were talking about a feminine object, such as a vase, you would use the feminine form of the preposition and say "le vase est sur la table".

### Conclusion 

Compound prepositions are an important part of the French language, and mastering them can take some time and practice. However, with a little effort, you'll soon be able to use them correctly to indicate the relationships between different parts of your sentences.
