# French Imperfect Tense

The French Imperfect Tense (L'imparfait) is a past tense that is widely used in the French language. It is formed by taking the first-person singular indicative of the verb, removing the 'ons', and adding the relevant imperfect endings. 

The imperfect tense primarily describes ongoing, habitual, or repeated actions in the past. It is also used to provide background information, describe states, and set the scene in narratives. 

## Formation of the French Imperfect Tense

To form the imperfect tense, take the first-person singular form of the infinitive verb in present tense, remove the 'ons', and add the following endings:

| Subject Pronouns | -ER verbs | -IR verbs | -RE verbs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| je (I) | -ais | -issais | -ais |
| tu (you, singular) | -ais | -issais | -ais |
| il/elle/on (he/she/it) | -ait | -issait | -ait |
| nous (we) | -ions | -issions | -ions |
| vous (you, plural or formal singular) | -iez | -issiez | -iez |
| ils/elles (they) | -aient | -issaient | -aient |

Some examples of the French Imperfect tense formation with -ER, -IR, and -RE verbs are:

- **Travailler (to work)**
  - Je travaillais, tu travaillais, il/elle/on travaillait, nous travaillions, vous travailliez, ils/elles travaillaient.

- **Finir (to finish)**
  - Je finissais, tu finissais, il/elle/on finissait, nous finissions, vous finissiez, ils/elles finissaient.

- **Vendre (to sell)**
  - Je vendais, tu vendais, il/elle/on vendait, nous vendions, vous vendiez, ils/elles vendaient.

## Usage of French Imperfect Tense

The French Imperfect tense is mostly used in the following situations:

### 1. Ongoing, habitual or repeated actions

The imperfect tense is commonly used to describe ongoing, habitual or repeated actions in the past. For example:

- Quand j'étais jeune, je jouais souvent avec mes amis. (When I was young, I used to play often with my friends.)

- Nous mangions toujours à la même heure. (We used to eat at the same time always.)

### 2. Background information

The imperfect tense is used to provide background information and context to a story or description. For example:

- Il faisait beau ce matin-là. Les oiseaux chantaient et le soleil brillait. (It was a beautiful morning. Birds were singing, and the sun was shining.)

- J'avais vingt ans quand j'ai rencontré ma femme. (I was twenty when I met my wife.)

### 3. Describing states

The imperfect tense is also used to describe states in the past. For example:

- Quand elle était jeune, elle était très sportive. (When she was young, she was very athletic.)

- Il était malheureux à cause de son travail. (He was unhappy because of his job.)

### 4. Setting the scene in narratives

In narratives, the imperfect tense is used to set the scene and describe events that are happening simultaneously. For example:

- Le train roulait lentement sur les rails. Les passagers discutaient et lisaient des journaux. (The train was moving slowly on the tracks. The passengers were talking and reading newspapers.)

- Il pleuvait depuis des heures, et les rues étaient désertes. (It had been raining for hours, and the streets were empty.)

## Conclusion

The French Imperfect tense is a useful past tense to describe ongoing, habitual, and repeated actions in the past. By following the rule of removing '-ons' from the first-person singular verb form and then adding the relevant imperfect endings, forming the imperfect tense is easy. It is an essential part of the French language and adds depth and context to your sentences, whether speaking or writing.
