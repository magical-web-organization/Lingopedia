French is known for its complex verb system, with multiple tenses, moods, and forms. As a French learner or student, it can be overwhelming to try to navigate all of these different verb conjugations. That’s why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide to French verb tenses, complete with a full list of tenses and examples to help you make sense of it all.

## The Basics of French Verb Conjugation
Before we dive into the different tenses, let’s review some of the basics of French verb conjugation. A verb in French can take many different forms depending on its tense (when it happens), mood (how it’s expressed), and subject (who is doing the action). In French, there are three regular verb conjugations, or “types” of verbs. These are:

- Regular –er verbs: These make up the largest group of French verbs and include words like parler (to speak), manger (to eat), and marcher (to walk).
- Regular –ir verbs: These include verbs like finir (to finish), choisir (to choose), and grandir (to grow).
- Regular –re verbs: These are verbs like vendre (to sell), attendre (to wait), and battre (to beat).

In addition to these regular verb conjugations, there are also many irregular verbs in French that have unique conjugations depending on the tense, mood, and subject.

## The French Verb Tenses
Now that we’ve reviewed some of the basics, let’s take a look at the different French verb tenses. We’ll start with the present tense, which is the most basic and important tense in French.

### Present Tense
The present tense (le présent) is used to talk about actions that are happening now or that happen regularly. Here is an example of a regular –er verb in the present tense:
