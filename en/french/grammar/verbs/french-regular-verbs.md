Learning a new language is always an exciting experience, but it can also be overwhelming, especially when it comes to grammar rules and verb conjugation. French is no exception, but with some practice and guidance, it is possible to master the basics of French regular verbs.

### What is a regular verb?

Before diving into French regular verbs, it is important to understand what a regular verb is. A regular verb is a verb whose conjugation follows a predictable pattern. In French, regular verbs belong to three groups, each corresponding to a different ending (-er, -ir, and -re).

### Regular verbs ending in -er

The largest group of regular verbs in French end in -er. These verbs are also known as first-group verbs. Examples include parler (to speak), manger (to eat), and aimer (to love). 

#### Conjugation of -er verbs

The present tense conjugation of -er verbs is as follows:

| Pronoun | Verb Ending |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | -e          |
| tu     | -es         |
| il/elle/on | -e      |
| nous   | -ons        |
| vous   | -ez         |
| ils/elles | -ent     |

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | parle       |
| tu     | parles      |
| il/elle/on | parle   |
| nous   | parlons     |
| vous   | parlez      |
| ils/elles | parlent |

To use a regular verb in the past tense, simply add the appropriate form of avoir or être as an auxiliary verb and the past participle of the verb. For -er verbs, the past participle ends in -é.

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| j'ai   | parlé       |
| tu as  | parlé       |
| il/elle/on a | parlé |
| nous avons | parlé   |
| vous avez | parlé    |
| ils/elles ont | parlé |

### Regular verbs ending in -ir

The second group of regular verbs in French ends in -ir. These verbs are also known as second-group verbs. Examples include finir (to finish), choisir (to choose), and réussir (to succeed).

#### Conjugation of -ir verbs

The present tense conjugation of -ir verbs is as follows:

| Pronoun | Verb Ending |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | -is         |
| tu     | -is         |
| il/elle/on | -it      |
| nous   | -issons     |
| vous   | -issez      |
| ils/elles | -issent  |

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | finis       |
| tu     | finis       |
| il/elle/on | finit  |
| nous   | finissons   |
| vous   | finissez    |
| ils/elles | finissent |

To use a regular verb ending in -ir in the past tense, simply add the appropriate form of avoir or être as an auxiliary verb and the past participle of the verb. For -ir verbs, the past participle ends in -i.

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| j'ai   | fini        |
| tu as  | fini        |
| il/elle/on a | fini  |
| nous avons | fini    |
| vous avez | fini     |
| ils/elles ont | fini |

### Regular verbs ending in -re

The third and smallest group of regular verbs in French ends in -re. These verbs are also known as third-group verbs. Examples include attendre (to wait), prendre (to take), and entendre (to hear).

#### Conjugation of -re verbs

The present tense conjugation of -re verbs is as follows:

| Pronoun | Verb Ending |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | -s          |
| tu     | -s          |
| il/elle/on | -        |
| nous   | -ons        |
| vous   | -ez         |
| ils/elles | -ent     |

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| je     | attends     |
| tu     | attends     |
| il/elle/on | attend  |
| nous   | attendons  |
| vous   | attendez   |
| ils/elles | attendent|

To use a regular verb ending in -re in the past tense, simply add the appropriate form of avoir or être as an auxiliary verb and the past participle of the verb. For -re verbs, the past participle ends in -u.

For example:

| Pronoun | Verb       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| j'ai   | attendu    |
| tu as  | attendu    |
| il/elle/on a | attendu|
| nous avons | attendu|
| vous avez | attendu |
| ils/elles ont | attendu|
