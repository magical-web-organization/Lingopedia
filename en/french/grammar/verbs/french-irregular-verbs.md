Learning French verb conjugation can be intimidating with all the rules to remember which tense to use and the different verb endings. However, there’s a group of French verbs that don’t follow these conventional rules - the French irregular verbs. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what these verbs are, how they're used, and some examples to help you get started.

## What are French irregular verbs?

French irregular verbs are those that don't follow the typical conjugation patterns in the different tenses. Unlike regular verbs that follow a set of rules for every tense, such as adding specific endings to the base verb or swapping out letters, irregular verbs are unique and require rote memorization in their conjugations.

## Different types of irregular verbs

Some French irregular verbs are only irregular in certain tenses, while others are irregular throughout the conjugation. Here are three types of irregular verbs.

### Verbs that end in -ir

A subclass of verbs ending in -ir has a unique conjugation pattern in the present tense. The stem of these verbs changes from an "i" to an "iss" before the endings are added. These verbs are called "verbs like ouvrir." Here are some examples:

- Ouvrir: J'ouvre, tu ouvres, il/elle ouvre, nous ouvrons, vous ouvrez, ils/elles ouvrent
- Offrir: J'offre, tu offres, il/elle offre, nous offrons, vous offrez, ils/elles offrent

### Verbs that end in -re

A few -re verbs are irregular in the present tense forms for tu, il, and elle. The ending for these change from "s" to "x," respectively. Here are some examples:

- Prendre: Je prends, tu prends, il/elle prend, nous prenons, vous prenez, ils/elles prennent
- Apprendre: J'apprends, tu apprends, il/elle apprend, nous apprenons, vous apprenez, ils/elles apprennent
- Mettre: Je mets, tu mets, il/elle met, nous mettons, vous mettez, ils/elles mettent

### Highly irregular verbs

There's a group of "highly" irregular verbs such as "aller," "être," "faire," and "avoir" that don't fit into any specific category. These verbs are used frequently and are vital to advanced-level French communication, so it's essential to learn their conjugations well. Here are some examples:

- Aller: Je vais, tu vas, il/elle va, nous allons, vous allez, ils/elles vont
- Être: Je suis, tu es, il/elle est, nous sommes, vous êtes, ils/elles sont
- Faire: Je fais, tu fais, il/elle fait, nous faisons, vous faites, ils/elles font
- Avoir: J'ai, tu as, il/elle a, nous avons, vous avez, ils/elles ont

## Tips to memorize irregular verbs

Learning irregular verbs can seem like a daunting task, but there are ways to make the process much more manageable. Here are some tips:

1. Group the verbs according to the conjugation they follow. If you can recognize a pattern, it will be easier to remember.

2. Write out the verbs in full, in present tense except for "être" and "avoir," creating flashcards.

3. Memorize one tense at a time.

4. Use a French-English dictionary regularly to improve recall.

## Final thoughts

Learning French irregular verbs takes dedication, practice, and some memorization. However, once you have them in your head, you’ll be able to use them correctly, making you that much closer to mastering the French language. Hopefully, this guide to French irregular verbs will help you on your way there.
