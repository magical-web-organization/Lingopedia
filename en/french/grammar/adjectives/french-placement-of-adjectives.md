Adjectives are an integral part of the French language, providing a way for speakers to add description and detail to their sentences. One of the key things to be aware of when using adjectives in French is their proper placement within a sentence. In this article, we will explore the French placement of adjectives and provide some tips for using them effectively.

## Placement of Adjectives

In French, adjectives usually come after the noun they describe. For example, in the sentence "le chien blanc" (the white dog), "blanc" is the adjective and it comes after the noun "chien". This is different from English, where adjectives typically come before the noun.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. In certain contexts, adjectives can come before the noun they describe. This is often the case when the adjective expresses a subjective or emotional quality, such as beauty or emotion. For example, in the sentence "un beau paysage" (a beautiful landscape), the adjective "beau" (beautiful) comes before the noun "paysage" (landscape).

Another exception is when the adjective is part of a set expression or a compound noun. For example, "un grand-père" (a grandfather), "un petit-déjeuner" (a breakfast), and "un court-métrage" (a short film) all have the adjective before the noun.

## Agreement of Adjectives

One other important aspect of using adjectives in French is the need to match them with the appropriate gender and number of the noun they describe. This means that the form of the adjective will change depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine, and whether it is singular or plural.

For example, in the sentence "une grande maison" (a big house), "grande" (big) is the feminine singular form of the adjective. If we were referring to a masculine singular noun, such as "un grand château" (a big castle), the adjective would be "grand" in its masculine singular form.

If the noun is plural, then the adjective must also be plural. For example, "des grands arbres" (big trees) and "des grandes maisons" (big houses) both use the plural form of the adjective "grand".

## Conclusion

In summary, adjectives are an important part of the French language, providing a way to add description and detail to sentences. When using adjectives in French, it is important to remember that they usually come after the noun they describe, with some exceptions. Additionally, the form of the adjective must match the gender and number of the noun it describes. By keeping these rules in mind, French learners can use adjectives effectively in their communication.
