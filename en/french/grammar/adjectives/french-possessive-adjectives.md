Possessive adjectives are used to show the possession or ownership of a person, animal or object. In French, possessive adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in both gender and number. They are placed before the noun they modify and often correspond to an English possessive pronoun. 

Here's a list of French possessive adjectives: 

| Possessive Adjective | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Masculine Plural | Feminine Plural |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| my                   | mon               | ma                | mes              | mes             |
| your (singular)      | ton               | ta                | tes              | tes             |
| his/her/its          | son               | sa                | ses              | ses             |
| our                  | notre             | notre             | nos              | nos             |
| your (plural)        | votre             | votre            | vos              | vos            |
| their                | leur              | leur              | leurs            | leurs           | 

Here are some examples of how to use possessive adjectives correctly: 

- **Ma voiture est rouge.** (My car is red.)
- **Ton chat est mignon.** (Your cat is cute.)
- **Sa maison est grande.** (His/her/its house is big.)
- **Notre famille est grande.** (Our family is big.)
- **Votre livre est intéressant.** (Your book is interesting.)
- **Leurs enfants sont bruyants.** (Their children are noisy.)

Note that possessive adjectives are used to show possession, whereas possessive pronouns are used to replace a noun and show possession. For example: 

- **C'est mon livre.** (It's my book.)
- **Le livre est à moi.** (The book is mine.)

In summary, French possessive adjectives are used to show possession and must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. It is important to use them correctly to avoid confusion and misunderstandings.
