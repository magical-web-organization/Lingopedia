## Introduction

Demonstrative adjectives are used to indicate a specific noun. In French, there are four demonstrative adjectives: **ce**, **cette**, **ces**, and **ceux**. Each of these adjectives agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies. It is important to note that French has two different sets of demonstrative adjectives, one for near objects and other for far objects.

## Near Objects

The demonstrative adjectives used for near objects are **ce** for masculine singular nouns, **cette** for feminine singular nouns, and **ces** for all plural nouns.

Here are a few examples:

- Ce livre (This book)
- Cette chaise (This chair)
- Ces stylos (These pens)

## Far Objects

The demonstrative adjective used for far objects is **ceux**. It is used for both masculine and feminine plural nouns.

Here are a few examples:

- Ceux-là sont les miens. (Those over there are mine.)
- Je préfère ces chaussures à ceux-ci. (I prefer these shoes to those.)

## Usage

Demonstrative adjectives are used before the noun they modify. They must agree with the gender and number of the noun. In addition to indicating specific nouns, they can also be used to distinguish one person or thing from another.

Here are a few more examples:

- Ce chapeau est plus grand que cette casquette. (This hat is bigger than this cap.)
- Ces fleurs sont belles. (These flowers are beautiful.)
- J'aime ce film-ci mais je n'aime pas celui-là. (I like this film, but I don't like that one.)

## Conclusion

Learning French demonstrative adjectives is important to communicate effectively in the language. Remember that there are two different sets of demonstrative adjectives for near and far objects. Choosing the right one and ensuring it agrees with the noun is key to constructing effective sentences.
