In French, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the nouns they describe. This means that the form of the adjective changes depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine, and singular or plural. In this article, we'll look at the rules of adjective agreement in French, some common exceptions, and examples to help you understand how it works.

## Gender Agreement

In French, all nouns have a gender: they are either masculine or feminine. Adjectives that describe these nouns must agree in gender, meaning that the form of the adjective changes depending on the gender of the noun it modifies. 

### Masculine Nouns

If the noun is masculine, the adjective is usually also masculine. For example:

- Un chat gris (a gray cat)
- Un livre intéressant (an interesting book)
- Un ami cher (a dear friend)

The default masculine form of the adjective is used for both singular and plural masculine nouns. For example:

- Des chats gris (gray cats)
- Des livres intéressants (interesting books)
- Des amis chers (dear friends)

### Feminine Nouns

If the noun is feminine, the adjective is usually also feminine. For example:

- Une voiture rouge (a red car)
- Une maison grande (a big house)
- Une amie chère (a dear friend)

The default feminine form of the adjective is used for both singular and plural feminine nouns. For example:

- Des voitures rouges (red cars)
- Des maisons grandes (big houses)
- Des amies chères (dear friends)

## Number Agreement

In French, nouns can be singular or plural, and adjectives must agree in number with the noun they modify. This means that the form of the adjective changes depending on whether the noun is singular or plural.

### Singular Nouns

If the noun is singular, the adjective takes its singular form. For example:

- Un chat gris (a gray cat)
- Une voiture rouge (a red car)
- Un livre intéressant (an interesting book)
- Une maison grande (a big house)

### Plural Nouns

If the noun is plural, the adjective takes its plural form. In general, this means adding an -s to the end of the adjective when it describes a plural noun. For example:

- Des chats gris (gray cats)
- Des voitures rouges (red cars)
- Des livres intéressants (interesting books)
- Des maisons grandes (big houses)

## Exceptions to the Rules

As with any rule in French, there are some exceptions to the rules of adjective agreement. Here are some of the most common ones:

### Adjectives that don't change

Some adjectives have the same form for both masculine and feminine nouns, and for both singular and plural nouns. These adjectives are usually either colors or nationalities. For example:

- Un drapeau bleu (a blue flag)
- Une voiture bleue (a blue car)
- Des drapeaux bleus (blue flags)
- Des voitures bleues (blue cars)

- Un enfant japonais (a Japanese child)
- Une enfant japonaise (a Japanese child)
- Des enfants japonais (Japanese children)
- Des enfants japonaises (Japanese children)

### Adjectives that come before the noun

Adjectives that come before the noun they modify usually take their normal form, regardless of the gender or number of the noun. For example:

- Un grand homme (a tall man)
- Un grande femme (a tall woman)
- Des grands arbres (tall trees)
- Des grandes maisons (big houses)

### Compound adjectives

Compound adjectives are made up of more than one word, and they usually take their usual form, depending on the gender and number of the noun. For example:

- Un livre beaucoup lu (a much-read book)
- Une maison bien entretenue (a well-maintained house)
- Des amis tout nouveaux (brand new friends)
- Des robes très chères (very expensive dresses)
