# French Conjunctions: Ou

In French, "ou" is a conjunction that means "or". Just like in English, "ou" is used to connect two items or choices, presenting them as alternatives.

## Using "ou" in French

"Ou" is commonly used in French to create a contrast between two or more options or possibilities. Here are a few examples:

- Tu veux boire de l'eau ou du jus?
  - Do you want to drink water or juice?
- Nous pouvons aller à la plage ou à la montagne.
  - We can go to the beach or to the mountain.

It is important to note that "ou" is always exclusive in French. This means that when presented with two options, you must choose one or the other, but not both. 

For example, the sentence "Je vais acheter une robe ou un pantalon" would require you to choose to either buy a dress or pants—not both.

## Special cases

There are a few special cases where "ou" can be used a bit differently in French.

- When "ou" is used in a negative sentence (i.e. one that includes "ne...pas"), it means "nor".
  - Je n'aime ni les épinards ni les asperges.
    - I don't like spinach nor asparagus.

- Another scenario where "ou" can be used differently is when it is followed by an adjective, and means "either...or". 
  - Tu es soit courageux, soit téméraire.
    - You're either brave or foolhardy.

## Conclusion

"Ou" is a simple yet powerful conjunction that is frequently used in everyday conversation. Remember that it is exclusive in nature when connecting two items or choices. Keep those rules in mind and you'll have no trouble using "ou" effectively in your French conversations.
