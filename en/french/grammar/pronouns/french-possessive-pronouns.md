# French Possessive Pronouns

French possessive pronouns are a type of pronoun that indicate ownership or possession of something or someone. They are used in place of a possessive adjective, such as "mon" (my), "ton" (your), or "son" (his/her/its), and they replace the noun that would follow the adjective.

There are a few key differences between possessive adjectives and pronouns in French. For one, possessive adjectives always agree in gender and number with the noun they modify, while possessive pronouns do not. Additionally, possessive adjectives are used before a noun, while possessive pronouns are used by themselves to replace the noun that would come after the adjective. 

Here are the French possessive pronouns:

| Person      | Masculine singular | Feminine singular | Masculine plural | Feminine plural |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1st person  | le mien           | la mienne         | les miens        | les miennes      |
| 2nd person  | le tien           | la tienne         | les tiens        | les tiennes      |
| 3rd person  | le sien           | la sienne         | les siens        | les siennes      |

To use a French possessive pronoun in a sentence, simply substitute it for the noun that would come after the possessive adjective. For example, instead of saying "j'aime mon livre" (I love my book), you could say "j'aime le mien" (I love mine). 

It's important to note that French possessive pronouns can also be used with prepositions. When used with "à", for example, the pronoun changes to "au mien", "au tien", or "au sien". When used with "de", the pronoun becomes "du mien", "du tien", or "du sien". 

Here are some examples of French possessive pronouns in action:

- Ce chien est le sien. (This dog is his/hers.)
- Je préfère mes chaussures, mais les tiennes sont aussi jolies. (I prefer my shoes, but yours are also pretty.)
- Le livre est à moi, pas au tien. (The book is mine, not yours.)

In summary, French possessive pronouns are a useful tool for indicating ownership or possession of something or someone. They are different from possessive adjectives, and are used by themselves to replace a noun. Understanding how to use them correctly can greatly improve your French language skills.
