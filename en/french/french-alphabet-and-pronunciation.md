If you're planning to learn French, starting with the alphabet is a great place to start. French is a Romance language that uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. However, the French language has a few extra letters and diacritical marks that distinguish it from the English alphabet. In this article, we'll explore the French alphabet and its pronunciation.

## The French Alphabet

The French alphabet contains 26 letters, just like the English alphabet. However, the French language has five additional accented letters, which are:

- é
- à
- ù
- è
- ë

These letters are pronounced differently than their unaccented counterparts, as we will explore later in this article.

Here's a list of the French alphabet:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

## Pronunciation of the French Alphabet

While many letters in the French alphabet are pronounced similar to their English counterparts, there are a few exceptions that you should be aware of.

### Vowels

The pronunciation of vowels in French can be difficult for English speakers to master. In French, vowels are pronounced differently depending on their accent marks.

- **A:** Pronounced like the "a" in "cat", unless it has an accent, and then it is pronounced like "ah".
- **E:** Pronounced like the "eh" in "pet" or the "ay" in "day", depending on its position in the word.
- **I:** Pronounced like the "ee" in "see".
- **O:** Pronounced like the "o" in "pot", unless it has an accent, and then it is pronounced like "oh".
- **U:** Pronounced like the "oo" in "too" or "you".

### Consonants

Most consonants in the French alphabet are pronounced similarly to their English counterparts. However, there are a few exceptions:

- **C:** Pronounced like a "k" sound, unless it is followed by the letters "e", "i", or "y", in which case it is pronounced like an "s" sound.
- **H:** Often silent in French, but when it is pronounced, it makes an "h" sound, similar to English.
- **Q:** Always followed by the letter "u" and pronounced like "k".
- **R:** A distinctively French "r" sound, which involves the back of the tongue vibrating. This sound can be difficult for English speakers to master.
- **W:** Used in only a few loanwords in French, and is pronounced like the English "w".
- **X:** Pronounced like the "ks" in "box".
- **Y:** Pronounced like the "ee" in "see", but with rounded lips.

## Conclusion

Learning the French alphabet and its pronunciation is an important first step in learning the French language. While some letters are pronounced similarly to their English counterparts, others require a new and unique way of uttering them. Keep practicing and listening carefully to native French speakers to refine your pronunciation. Happy learning!
