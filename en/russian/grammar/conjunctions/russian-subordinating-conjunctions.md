# Russian Subordinating Conjunctions

In the Russian language, subordinate clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions. These conjunctions are used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause. Subordinating conjunctions change the structure and meaning of the sentence and help to clarify the relationship between the ideas in the sentence.

Let's take a look at some commonly used subordinating conjunctions in Russian:

## Что (That)

Что is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause indicating that the subject of the subordinate clause is the same as the subject of the main clause. 

Example:

```
Я знаю, что ты умён. (I know that you are smart.)
```

In this sentence, "тый умён" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Я знаю" by the subordinating conjunction "что." 

## Как (As, Like)

Как is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause to indicate that the two subjects are similar or synonymous.

Example:

```
Она улыбалась, как солнце. (She smiled like the sun.)
```

In this sentence, "как солнце" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Она улыбалась" by the subordinating conjunction "как." 

## Когда (When)

Когда is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause to describe the time when an action in the main clause occurred.

Example:

```
Он вернётся, когда закончит работу. (He will return when he finishes work.)
```

In this sentence, "когда закончит работу" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Он вернётся" by the subordinating conjunction "когда." 

## Пока (While)

Пока is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause to describe actions that occur simultaneously.

Example:

```
Она поёт, пока убирает комнату. (She sings while cleaning the room.)
```

In this sentence, "пока убирает комнату" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Она поёт" by the subordinating conjunction "пока." 

## Чтобы (In Order To)

Чтобы is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause to indicate purpose or intent.

Example:

```
Он студент, чтобы получить высшее образование. (He is a student in order to get a higher education.)
```

In this sentence, "чтобы получить высшее образование" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Он студент" by the subordinating conjunction "чтобы." 

## Раз (Since, Because)

Раз is used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause to indicate the cause of the action in the main clause.

Example:

```
Я не ем конфеты, раз они вредны для здоровья. (I don't eat candy since it's harmful for your health.)
```

In this sentence, "раз они вредны для здоровья" is the subordinate clause and it is connected to the main clause "Я не ем конфеты" by the subordinating conjunction "раз." 

## Conclusion

Subordinating conjunctions in the Russian language change the structure and meaning of the sentence and help to clarify the relationship between the ideas in the sentence. By understanding the different types of subordinating conjunctions, you can create more complex and sophisticated sentences in Russian.
