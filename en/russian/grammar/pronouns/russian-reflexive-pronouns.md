Reflexive pronouns are an essential aspect of the Russian language. These pronouns are indispensable when trying to express the action of the subject on themselves. Learning Russian reflexive pronouns can be a bit overwhelming, especially for beginners. However, through a thorough understanding, you can become an expert in using them. In this article, we will examine the different types of reflexive pronouns, how to use them, and give examples.

## Definition of Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same. They help express an action that a subject does for themselves, and not for others. For example, "I wash myself" or "He cut himself."  The reflexive pronoun used in these sentences is "myself" and "himself," respectively.

## Types of Reflexive Pronouns 

In Russian, there are two types of reflexive pronouns: 

1. **Direct Reflexive Pronouns**

These pronouns take the form of neuter-gender nouns and are typically used in the third person. Examples include "себя," which means "himself/herself/itself/oneself." Here are some examples: 

- Я видел его в зеркале. ("I saw himself in the mirror.")
- Она всегда готовит для себя. ("She always cooks for herself.")

2. **Indirect Reflexive Pronouns**

These pronouns refer to the same person as the subject but are not identical to the subject's gender. They usually end in "ся." Examples include the following: 

- Мой друг сделался известным. ("My friend became famous.")
- Я только что проснулся. ("I just woke up.")

## How to Use Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns in Russian are an essential part of the language, and their usage is reasonably straightforward. The verb that requires the reflexive pronoun needs to be conjugated accordingly. For instance, in the sentence, "I wash myself," the verb "wash" needs to be conjugated to match the subject's form. Here are some basic rules to keep in mind:

- Always use "себя" if it is a direct reflexive pronoun.
- If a sentence expresses an action the subject does to themselves or to their possessions, use the reflexive pronoun.
- If a sentence expresses an action the subject does to someone or something else, do not use the reflexive pronoun.

## Conclusion

Reflexive pronouns are a crucial aspect of the Russian language, and understanding their usage and forms can help improve your communication. They help create more natural sentences and express actions that only relate to the subject. Remember to use them correctly and aim to develop a deeper understanding of their usage in the language.
