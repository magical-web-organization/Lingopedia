### Как (Kak)

## How to Use Interrogative Pronouns

Now that you know the different interrogative pronouns used in the Russian language, let's see how to use them in your conversations.

To form a question using an interrogative pronoun, you simply place the interrogative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence. Here are some examples:

- Что это? (Shto eta?) - What is this?
- Куда ты идешь? (Kuda ty idesh?) - Where are you going?
- Когда ты придешь? (Kogda ty pridyosh?) - When will you come?

Keep in mind that interrogative pronouns must agree in gender and number with the noun or pronoun they refer to.
