## Introduction
Russian nouns are an essential part of the language and so are the grammatical cases. The prepositional case, also known as the sixth case, is used to indicate the location of a person or an object. It answers the question “о ком?/о чём?” that means “about what/whom?”. In this article, we will discuss how to form and use the prepositional case in Russian.

## Formation of Prepositional Case
To form the prepositional case, you need to add a preposition “о” or “об” (if the noun starts with a vowel) before the noun and change the ending to the prepositional case ending, depending on the gender and number of the noun. The prepositional case endings for singular and plural nouns are as follows:

- Masculine -е/-ь
- Feminine -е
- Neuter -е
- Plural -ах/-ях

Let’s take the noun “дом” (house) as an example to form the prepositional case. 

- о (about) + дом (house) = о домЕ (about the house)

Here are some examples of different gender and number nouns in the prepositional case:

- МашинА (car) - о машинЕ (about the car) 
- Друг (friend) - о другЕ (about the friend)
- СолнцЕ (sun) - об солнцЕ (about the sun)
- Родители (parents) - о родителях (about the parents)

## Usage of Prepositional Case
The prepositional case is primarily used to indicate the location of a person or an object. It is also used in some expressions like “нет никогдА”(never) and “вечерОм” (in the evening). Here are some examples of using prepositions in the Russian language:

- Я говорил о своей работЕ (I talked about my work)
- Он стоит возле дверИ (He is standing near the door)
- Я никогдА не ем после шести вечерОм (I never eat after six in the evening)

## Conclusion
The prepositional case is an essential part of the Russian language, and it is used to indicate the location of a person or an object. To form the prepositional case, you need to add the preposition “о” or “об” before the noun and change the ending to the prepositional case ending, depending on the gender and number of the noun. The Russian language has six grammatical cases, and mastering them is crucial for effective communication in Russian.
