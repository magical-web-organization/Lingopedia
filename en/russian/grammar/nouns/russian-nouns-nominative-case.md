## Introduction

The Russian language is known for its complex grammar rules, particularly when it comes to cases. There are six cases in Russian: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Instrumental, and Prepositional. In this article, we will focus on the Nominative case and how it is used for nouns.

## What is the Nominative case?

The Nominative case is the case that is used for the subject of a sentence. This means that a noun in the Nominative case is the noun that performs the action in the sentence.

For example:

- Я люблю кофе. (I love coffee.) In this sentence, я (I) is in the Nominative case because it is the subject of the sentence.

- Солнце светит ярко. (The sun is shining brightly.) In this sentence, солнце (sun) is in the Nominative case because it is the subject of the sentence.

## How to form nouns in the Nominative case

The forms of nouns in the Nominative case depend on their gender and whether they are singular or plural.

### Singular Nouns

- Masculine Nouns: Most masculine nouns ending in a consonant have the same form in the Nominative and Accusative cases. For example: стол (table), растение (plant).

Masculine nouns ending in -a, -я, -ь have a different form in the Nominative case. 

For example:

- папа (dad) becomes папа in Nominative.
- дядя (uncle) becomes дядя in Nominative.
- медведь (bear) becomes медведь in Nominative.

- Feminine Nouns: Most feminine nouns have the same form in the Nominative and Accusative cases. For example: дверь (door), радость (joy).

Feminine nouns ending in -а have a different form in the Nominative case. 

For example:

- мама (mom) becomes мама in Nominative.
- сестра (sister) becomes сестра in Nominative.
- кошка (cat) becomes кошка in Nominative.

- Neuter Nouns: Most neuter nouns have the same form in the Nominative and Accusative cases. For example: окно (window), море (sea).

Neuter nouns ending in -о have a different form in the Nominative case. 

For example:

- яблоко (apple) becomes яблоко in Nominative.
- молоко (milk) becomes молоко in Nominative.
- платье (dress) becomes платье in Nominative.

### Plural Nouns

To form plural nouns in the Nominative case, simply add -ы, -и or -а to the end of the noun, depending on its gender and its ending in the singular form.

For example:

- столы (tables)
- двери (doors)
- окна (windows)
