Russian noun number agreement, or the rule that governs how nouns change form to reflect quantity or number, is a fundamental aspect of Russian grammar that every learner needs to master for effective communication and clear writing.

In Russian, nouns can be singular (referring to one person, place, or thing) or plural (referring to multiple persons, places, or things). The endings of nouns change depending on whether they are singular or plural and whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.

Masculine Nouns

In Russian, masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, -ий, -ый, -ой, -ый, -ий, -some "-ь", or the plural-only ending "-и." To form the plural, the following changes occur:

- For nouns ending in a consonant, add the suffix -ы or -и.

- For nouns ending in -ий or -й, replace the ending with -ие.

- For nouns ending in -я or -а, replace the ending with -и.

- For nouns ending in -о or -е, add -а or -я.

- Nouns that end with "-ь" require a soft sign before adding the plural ending "-и." 

Example: 

Singular: Дом (dom) – House 

Plural: Дома (doma) – Houses 

Feminine Nouns

Feminine nouns in Russian can be divided into two groups - hard and soft. The ending change of feminine nouns to form the plural usually depends on the last letter/syllable of the stem.

Hard-Feminine Nouns: 

- For feminine nouns ending in a consonant, add the suffix -ы or -и.

- For nouns ending in -а, replace the ending with -ы.

- For nouns ending in -и or -я, replace the ending -и with -и.

Soft-Feminine Nouns: 

- For feminine nouns ending in a "ь," change "ь" to "и" and then add the plural-ending "-и."

- For nouns ending in -ся, -жа or -ча, drop the existing ending and replace with -и or -ы.

Example 

Singular: Мама (mama) – Mother

Plural: Мамы (mamy) - Mothers

Neuter Nouns

Neuter nouns typically end in -о, -мя, or -ие. To form the plural:

- For nouns ending in -о, add -а or -я.

- For nouns ending -мя or -ие replace the end with -я. 

Example:

Singular: Окно (okno) - Window

Plural: Окна (okna) - Windows
