In Russian grammar, each noun can be declined, or put into different cases, to indicate its function in a sentence or its relationship to other words in the sentence. The genitive case is one of six Russian noun cases and is used to express possession, negation, absence, and several other concepts. This article will explain more about the genitive case and how to use it correctly.

## When to use the genitive case

### Possession

One of the primary uses of the genitive case is to indicate possession. In Russian, the genitive case is used to show that one object belongs to another. To form the genitive case of a noun, you need to remove the ending of the nominative case and add the appropriate ending. For example:

- дело (neutral gender, singular) - дела (genitive singular)
- деньги (plural) - денег (genitive plural)

### Negation

The genitive case is also used to express negation. In Russian, the negation particle "нет" (no) is followed by a noun in the genitive case. For example:

- У меня нет книги. (I do not have a book.)
- У него нет дома. (He does not have a house.)

### Absence

The genitive case can also be used to show the absence of something or someone. In these cases, the genitive noun is often preceded by the preposition "без" (without). For example:

- Она пришла без денег. (She came without money.)
- Я не могу жить без тебя. (I cannot live without you.)

### Other uses

The genitive case can also be used in the following ways:

- After certain prepositions such as "из" (from), "от" (from), "с" (with), "у" (at), and "до" (until).
- After numbers that end in two, three or four, except for those that end in 11, 12 or 13.
- After certain verbs, such as "хватает" (lacks) and "хочется" (wants).

## Examples

Here are some examples of sentences using the genitive case:

- Я купил новый компьютер. (I bought a new computer.)
- Я купил чехол для компьютера. (I bought a case for the computer.)
- У ребенка нет игрушек. (The child does not have any toys.)
- Он пьет чай без сахара. (He is drinking tea without sugar.)
- Я жду автобуса уже час. (I have been waiting for a bus for an hour.)

## Conclusion

The genitive case is an essential part of Russian grammar and is used to indicate possession, negation, absence, and several other concepts. To form the genitive case of a noun, you need to remove the ending of the nominative case and add the appropriate ending. By understanding the genitive case and how to use it correctly, you will be able to communicate more effectively in Russian.
