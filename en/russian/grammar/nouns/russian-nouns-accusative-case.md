## Russian Nouns: Accusative Case

In Russian grammar, noun declension is a fundamental aspect of the language. There are six cases in the Russian language, and the Accusative case is one of them. The Accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of a sentence, and its endings vary depending on the gender of the noun.

### Usage of Accusative Case

The Accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of a sentence. In other words, it answers the question "What?" or "Whom?" in relation to the action of the verb. The Accusative case is also used after certain prepositions, such as "в" (in), "на" (on), "за" (behind), and "перед" (in front of).

### How to Form Accusative Case Endings

The Accusative case endings for Russian nouns depend on their gender and whether they are animate or inanimate. Here are the Accusative case endings for each gender:

#### Masculine Nouns

* If the noun ends in a consonant, add "-а" for animate nouns and "-я" for inanimate nouns.
* If the noun ends in "-й", replace it with "-я" for animate nouns and "-й" for inanimate nouns.
* If the noun ends in "-ь", replace it with "-я" for both animate and inanimate nouns.
