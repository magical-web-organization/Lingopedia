Russian participles are a type of verb form that combines the qualities of a verb and an adjective. They are usually formed by adding a suffix to the stem of the verb. Participles in Russian can be used to form complex sentences, describe actions and things, and express various types of relations.

There are two types of participles in the Russian language: active and passive. An active participle describes an action performed by someone, while a passive participle describes an action done to someone or something. Both types of participles can be used in different tenses and cases.

Formation of Russian Participles

To form participles in Russian, you need to take the stem of the verb and add the appropriate suffix. The suffixes depend on the tense and the type of the participle. Below are some examples of how to form participles in Russian:

Active Participles

Present: Stem + щий
For example, бегать (to run) → бегающий (running)

Past: Stem + вший
For example, играть (to play) → игравший (having played)

Passive Participles

Present: Stem + емый
For example, есть (to eat) → едимый (edible)

Past: Stem + нный
For example, знать (to know) → знанный (known)

Usage of Russian Participles

Participles in the Russian language are used in many different ways. Here are some examples of how they can be used:

1. To form compound verbs:
In Russian, you can use participles with other verbs to create compound verbs. For example:
Я начинаю читать – I start reading.

2. To create complex sentences:
Participles can also be used to create complex sentences. For example:
Пошел, не сказав прощай. – He left without saying goodbye.

3. As adjectives:
Participles can also be used as adjectives to describe things or situations. For example:
Оставить дома маленькую дочку было нашей ошибкой. – Leaving the little daughter at home was our mistake.

4. In subordinate clauses:
Participles can be used in subordinate clauses. For example:

Конечно, говорить правду – наша обязанность. – Of course, telling the truth is our duty.
