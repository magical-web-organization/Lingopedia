If you're learning Russian, one of the first things you will encounter is the present tense. It is a fundamental grammatical element in the language and is used in a myriad of ways. In this article, we will explore the Russian present tense, its conjugation, usage, and examples.

## Russian Present Tense Conjugation

The Russian present tense changes depending on the gender, number, and person of the subject. For example, the present tense for the verb "to be" (быть) is:

| Subject | Present Tense |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Я (I)  | есть         |
| Ты (You) | е́сть        |
| Он/Она/Оно (He/She/It) | есть  |
| Мы (We)  | есть         |
| Вы (You, formal or plural) | е́сть   |
| Они (They) | есть       |

As you can see, the verb "to be" changes depending on the subject. This is true for all verbs in the Russian language.

To form the present tense for most verbs, you need to remove the infinitive ending (-ть, -чь, -ти) and add the appropriate ending. Here are the endings based on the gender and number of the subject:

| Subject | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Я (I)  | -у (-ю)           | -у (-ю)           | -им     |
| Ты (You) | -ишь (-иш)         | -ишь (-иш)         | -ите    |
| Он/Она/Оно (He/She/It) | -ит (-ят)         | -ит (-ят)         | -ят     |
| Мы (We)  | -им              | -им              | -им     |
| Вы (You, formal or plural) | -ите             | -ите             | -ите    |
| Они (They) | -ят              | -ят              | -ят     |

For example, let's take the verb "to speak" (говорить). Here are the present tense forms:

| Subject | Present Tense |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Я (I)  | говорю       |
| Ты (You) | говоришь     |
| Он/Она/Оно (He/She/It) | говорит  |
| Мы (We)  | говорим      |
| Вы (You, formal or plural) | говорите   |
| Они (They) | говорят    |
