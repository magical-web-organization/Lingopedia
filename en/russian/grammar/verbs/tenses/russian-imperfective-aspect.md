Russian language, with its intricate grammar and intricate nuances, may seem daunting at first to learn. Russian Imperfective Aspect is one such complexity of the language that can trip up new learners. However, understanding the differences between the Imperfective and Perfective aspects can help you become fluent in Russian more quickly and efficiently.

## What is the Russian Imperfective Aspect?

Russian has two aspects: Imperfective and Perfective. Aspect denotes an action's completeness - whether it's a completed action or an ongoing one. The Imperfective Aspect is the form of the verb that indicates an incomplete or ongoing action, while the Perfective Aspect denotes a completed action. Generally, the imperfective aspect is used when talking about an action that is ongoing, repetitive, or habitual.

For example, 
- Я пишу письмо (Ya pishu pismo) – I am writing a letter (ongoing action)
- Я писал электронное письмо (Ya pisal elektronnoe pismo) – I was writing an email (continuous action).

## How to form the Imperfective Aspect?

In Russian, the Imperfective Aspect can be formed in many ways. Here are some common ones:

1. By adding a suffix -ивать/-ывать to the stem of the verb to the present tense form of the verb. E.g. говорить (to say) - говорить (to be speaking)

2. By adding prefix не- to the stem of the verb. E.g. знать (to know) - не знать (to not know)

3. By using a different form of the verb. For example – пишу (I am writing) – писать (to write), говорю (I am speaking) – говорить (to be speaking).

## Imperfective Vs. Perfective Aspect in Russian

The differences between the Imperfective and Perfective Aspect in Russian are subtle yet important. The most significant difference is that the Imperfective Aspect portrays an action in progress, whereas the Perfective Aspect represents the completed action.

Consider the following example:
- Я писал письмо (Ya pisal pismo) - I was writing a letter (Imperfective)
- Я написал письмо. (Ya napisal pismo) - I wrote a letter. (Perfective)

Notice how the second sentence has the Perfective Aspect which denotes the completion of the action.

The Imperfective Aspect is used to describe:
- Ongoing, indefinite or unfinished actions
- Repeated or habitual actions

The Perfective Aspect is used to describe:
- Already completed action
- Single, finite, or completed actions

## Incorrect use of aspects

Using the wrong aspect of the verb in a sentence can totally alter its meaning. Therefore, it's essential to nail down the use of aspects when communicating in Russian. For instance, some sentences can have a different meaning using either aspect:

- Я не иду на работу (Ya ne idu na rabotu) – I am not going to work (Imperfective)
- Я не пошел на работу (Ya ne poshel na rabotu) – I did not go to work (Perfective)

In the first sentence, the speaker is indicating that they are not yet doing the action of going to work, whereas in the second sentence, the speaker is saying that they did not go at all. 

Similarly, let's consider another example.
- Я иду в банк (Ya idu v bank) - I am going to the bank (Imperfective)
- Я подошел к банку (Ya podoshel k banku) - I have arrived at the bank (Perfective)

Notice how one suggests the act of going is not completed, while the other indicates that the endpoint is achieved.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding the nuances of the Imperfective and Perfective aspects can take your Russian language skills up a notch. Russian's two aspects, when used correctly, help convey the meaning of your words more clearly and precisely. Ensure you master the Imperfective Aspect's formation and usage to avoid any miscommunication or confusion. Good Luck!
