Russian grammar can be quite daunting for learners because of its different characteristics from other languages. One of the most significant features of the Russian language is its verb aspects. Russian verbs are divided into two aspects: perfective and imperfective. Perfective verbs represent a completed action, while imperfective verbs indicate an incomplete or ongoing action.

In this article, we will explore the world of perfective verbs in Russian and learn their significance in the Russian language.

## What are Perfective Verbs?
Perfective verbs, also known as completed verbs, are used to indicate an action that has been completed or finished in the past, present or future. They represent a specific, limited period of time when the action took place. Russian perfective verbs often have a prefix that is added to the root verb to change its meaning or to create a new word.

For example:
- Идти (idti) - to go (imperfective aspect)
- Пойти (pojti) - to go (perfective aspect)

In the above example, the addition of the prefix "по" changes the meaning of the verb and indicates a specific limited period and completed action. Similarly, other prefixes that are used with perfective verbs are "вы-"(vы), "за-"(za), "с-"(s), "от-"(ot), and "пере-"(pere).

## When to use Perfective Verbs?
Perfective verbs are used to highlight completed actions that are finished in the past, present, or future. It is also used for counting repeated actions, indicating a specific limited period, and talking about goals and achievements.

For example:
- Я написал письмо - I wrote a letter
- Мы сходили в кино два раза на прошлой неделе - We went to the cinema twice last week
- Я съел пирог - I ate the pie

In the above examples, the completed actions are indicated by the use of perfective verbs.

## Differences between Perfective and Imperfective Verbs
Imperfective verbs, as mentioned earlier, indicate an ongoing or incomplete action. The main difference between perfective and imperfective verbs is that perfective verbs indicate completed actions, and imperfective verbs indicate an ongoing, incomplete, or repetitive action. 

For example:
- Она работает в банке (ona rabotaet v banke) - She works in a bank (imperfective aspect)
- Она поработала в банке (ona porabotala v banke) - She worked in a bank (perfective aspect)

In the above examples, the use of the imperfective verb "работает" indicates the ongoing nature of the action, while the perfective "поработала" indicates that the action was completed.

## Conclusion
Perfective verbs are an essential aspect of the Russian language as it helps communicate actions that have been completed or finished. The use of prefixes with root verbs to indicate a new word is unique in the Russian language, and proper usage of perfective and imperfective verbs is essential for effective communication.

As a learner of Russian, it's important to note that the usage of perfective and imperfective verbs can differ based on the context and type of action being referred to. Therefore, it's important to study and practice the usage of these verbs to become proficient in the Russian language.
