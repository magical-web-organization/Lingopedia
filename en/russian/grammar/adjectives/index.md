# Russian Adjectives

Russian adjectives play a vital role in constructing meaningful sentences. They are used to describe nouns and add details to the sentence. In this article, we will discuss Russian adjectives, their types, and how to use them in sentences.

## Types of Adjectives

### 1. Qualitative Adjectives:

Qualitative adjectives describe the quality and characteristics of a noun. They answer questions such as what kind of, which, or what sort of. For example:

- большой (bol'shoy) - big
- красивый (krasivyy) - beautiful
- медленный (medlennyy) - slow

### 2. Relative Adjectives:

Relative adjectives describe the relationship between two nouns. They answer questions such as whose, whom, or which. For example:

- мой (moy) - my
- его (yevo) - his
- наш (nash) - our

### 3. Possessive Adjectives:

Possessive adjectives show possession or ownership. They answer the question whose. For example:

- мой (moy) - my
- твой (tvoy) - your
- его (yevo) - his

## How to Use Adjectives in Sentences

In Russian, adjectives follow the noun they are describing. They agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. Here is an example:

- Я вижу большую кошку. (Ya vizhu bol'shuyu koshku) - I see a big cat.

In this sentence, the adjective большой (big) agrees with the noun кошка (cat) in gender (feminine) and number (singular).

In Russian, adjectives can also be used without a noun. In such cases, they must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they are replacing. For example:

- Этот дом красивый, а тот - уродливый. (Etot dom krasivyy, a tot - urodlivyy.) - This house is beautiful, but that one is ugly.

In this sentence, the adjective красивый (beautiful) agrees with the noun дом (house) in gender (masculine) and number (singular).
