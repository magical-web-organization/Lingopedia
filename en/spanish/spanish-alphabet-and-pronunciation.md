If you want to learn Spanish, one of the first things you should familiarize yourself with is the Spanish alphabet. Spanish has 27 letters, with one additional letter called "Ñ" (eñe). Pronouncing the Spanish alphabet can be tricky, and it takes some practice to get it right. In this article, we'll go over the Spanish alphabet and its pronunciation to help you get started on your Spanish language journey.

## The Spanish Alphabet

The Spanish alphabet has 27 letters, and they are:

```
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
```

There are no additional letters in the Spanish alphabet compared to the English alphabet, but it does have a unique letter called "Ñ" (eñe). It is pronounced as "enye."

## Pronunciation of the Spanish Alphabet

The pronunciation of the Spanish alphabet is different from that of the English alphabet, and it can be challenging for beginners. Here's how to pronounce the letters of the Spanish alphabet:

- **A**: Ah (as in "father")
- **B**: Beh (as in "baby")
- **C**: The letter "C" has two different sounds in Spanish. When it comes before "e" or "i," it sounds like "s" (as in "cent"). In all other cases, it sounds like "k" (as in "cat").
- **D**: Deh (as in "day")
- **E**: Eh (as in "get")
- **F**: Efe (as in "father")
- **G**: Like "C," the letter "G" has two different sounds in Spanish. When it comes before "e" or "i," it sounds like an English "H" (as in "hello"). In all other cases, it sounds like a hard "G" (as in "great").
- **H**: Hache (as in "hour"). In Spanish, the letter "H" is always silent.
- **I**: Ee (as in "see")
- **J**: Hota (as in "head"). The letter "J" is pronounced as an English "H."
- **K**: Ka (as in "king"). The letter "K" is not commonly used in Spanish and is only found in loanwords.
- **L**: Ele (as in "let")
- **M**: Eme (as in "meet")
- **N**: Ene (as in "need")
- **Ñ**: Eñe (as in "on-yay")
- **O**: Oh (as in "old")
- **P**: Pe (as in "pen")
- **Q**: Like "C" and "G," the letter "Q" has two different sounds in Spanish. It is always followed by a "u," and before "e" or "i," it sounds like "k" (as in "key"). In all other cases, it sounds like "kw" (as in "queen").
- **R**: Ere (as in "red"). The letter "R" is pronounced with a sound known as "rolled R," which is made by trilling the tongue against the roof of the mouth.
- **S**: Ese (as in "set")
- **T**: Te (as in "ten")
- **U**: Ooh (as in "too")
- **V**: Uve (as in "vase"). In Spanish, the letter "V" is pronounced like the English letter "B."
- **W**: Doble uve (as in "wet"). Like the letter "K," the letter "W" is not commonly used in Spanish and is only found in loanwords.
- **X**: Equis (as in "exit")
- **Y**: I griega (as in "eat"), or ye (as in "yet")
- **Z**: Zeta (as in "zoo")

The Spanish alphabet and its pronunciation may seem daunting at first, but with practice, it becomes more comfortable.
