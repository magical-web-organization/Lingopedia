In this article, we will discuss what quantitative adjectives are, their different types, and how to properly use them in sentences.

## What are Quantitative Adjectives?

Quantitative adjectives are words that describe the quantity or amount of nouns. They provide important information about the size or number of objects, people, or abstract ideas that are being discussed. Spanish has two main types of quantitative adjectives, which are known as cardinal and ordinal numbers.

### Cardinal Numbers

- uno (one)
- dos (two)
- tres (three)
- cuatro (four)
- cinco (five)
- seis (six)
- siete (seven)
- ocho (eight)
- nueve (nine)
- diez (ten)
- once (eleven)
- doce (twelve)
- trece (thirteen)
- catorce (fourteen)
- quince (fifteen)
- dieciséis (sixteen)

- setenta (seventy)
- ochenta (eighty)
- noventa (ninety)
- cien (one hundred)
- mil (one thousand)

### Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are used to describe the order or sequence of things. In Spanish, ordinal numbers are formed by adding the masculine or feminine ending to the cardinal number. For example:

- Primero/Primera (first)
- Segundo/Segunda (second)
- Tercero/Tercera (third)
- Cuarto/Cuarta (fourth)
- Quinto/Quinta (fifth)
- Sexto/Sexta (sixth)
- Séptimo/Séptima (seventh)
- Octavo/Octava (eighth)
- Noveno/Novena (ninth)
- Décimo/Décima (tenth)

## Correct Usage of Quantitative Adjectives in Sentences

Quantitative adjectives in Spanish need to agree with the nouns they are describing in gender and number. For example:

- Un perro (A dog)
- Dos perros (Two dogs)
- Tres perros (Three dogs)

When using ordinal numbers, always place the number before the noun. For example:

- El primer piso (The first floor)
- La quinta avenida (Fifth Avenue)

When using multiples of ten, the cardinal numbers must agree in gender with the noun. For example:

- Veinte años (Twenty years)
- Treinta niños (Thirty children)

In summary, quantitative adjectives are an essential aspect of the Spanish language that provides important information about the amount, size, or number of things being discussed. Be sure to learn and practice using them correctly in sentences to effectively communicate in Spanish.
