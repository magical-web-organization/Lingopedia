As you learn Spanish, you need to understand how to use adjectives. An adjective describes or modifies a noun, and it can be placed before or after the noun it modifies. In this article, we will explain the placement of adjectives in Spanish sentences.

## Placing Adjectives Before the Noun

In most cases, adjectives come after the noun they modify in Spanish. However, some adjectives are placed before the noun to give a different emphasis or meaning. Here are a few types of adjectives that are commonly placed before the noun:

### Descriptive Adjectives

Descriptive adjectives are often placed before the noun to give more emphasis on the quality being described. For example:

- El gran jardín (The big garden)
- La hermosa flor (The beautiful flower)

### Quantity Adjectives

Quantity adjectives are always placed before the noun. For example:

- Dos perros (Two dogs)
- Tres zapatos (Three shoes)

### Possessive Adjectives

Possessive adjectives indicate possession and are always placed before the noun. For example:

- Mi libro (My book)
- Su casa (His/Her/Their house)

## Placing Adjectives After the Noun

In most cases, adjectives come after the noun they modify in Spanish. Here are a few examples of how adjectives are placed after the noun:

- La casa roja (The red house)
- El perro grande (The big dog)
- La guitarra española (The Spanish guitar)

## Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to the general rules of adjective placement in Spanish. Here are some examples:

### Emphatic Adjectives

When an adjective is given more emphasis or intensifies the meaning, it can be placed before the noun. For example:

- Un gran esfuerzo (A great effort)
- Una feliz noticia (A happy news)

### Compound Nouns

Compound nouns, such as "hombre lobo" (werewolf), "paso a paso" (step by step), and "boca de metro" (subway entrance) have the adjective placed after the second noun. 

### Words that End in -ísimo

Adjectives that end in -ísimo, such as "rapiísimas" (very fast) and "buenísimo" (very good) are always placed after the noun. 

## Conclusion

Adjective placement in Spanish can be tricky, but with practice and learning the exceptions, you will be able to master the proper placement of adjectives. Remember, in most cases, adjectives are placed after the noun. However, there are exceptions where they should be placed before the noun to give a different emphasis or meaning.
