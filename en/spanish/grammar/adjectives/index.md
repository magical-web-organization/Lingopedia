# Spanish Adjectives

In Spanish, adjectives are words used to describe or modify a noun or pronoun. They usually come after the noun they describe, and they agree in gender and number with the noun. In this article, we will discuss the various types of Spanish adjectives and how they are used in sentences.

## Types of Spanish Adjectives

1. **Descriptive adjectives**
These are the most common type of adjectives in Spanish. Descriptive adjectives describe the physical or personal qualities of a noun. For example: 
- La casa grande (The big house)
- La chica inteligente (The intelligent girl)

2. **Quantitative adjectives**
Quantitative adjectives describe the amount or quantity of something. For example:
- Tengo cinco libros (I have five books)
- Compré dos camisas (I bought two shirts)

3. **Demonstrative adjectives**
Demonstrative adjectives are used to indicate a specific noun. For example:
- Este libro es interesante (This book is interesting)
- Aquellos chicos son simpáticos (Those boys are friendly)

4. **Possessive adjectives**
Possessive adjectives show ownership of a noun. They agree in gender and number with the noun being possessed. For example:
- Mi perro es grande (My dog is big)
- Nuestra casa es hermosa (Our house is beautiful)

5. **Interrogative adjectives**
Interrogative adjectives are used to ask questions about a noun. For example:
- ¿Qué libro prefieres? (What book do you prefer?)
- ¿Cuántas manzanas quieres? (How many apples do you want?)

## Placement of Adjectives

In Spanish, adjectives usually come after the noun they describe. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Adjectives used to describe beauty, size, age, goodness, and badness generally come before the noun. For example:
- Una hermosa flor (A beautiful flower)
- Una mala idea (A bad idea)

## Agreement of Adjectives

In Spanish, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they are modifying. For example:
- El gato negro (The black cat)
- La casa blanca (The white house)
- Los estudiantes inteligentes (The intelligent students)
- Las chicas simpáticas (The friendly girls)
