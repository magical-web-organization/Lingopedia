# Spanish Adverbs of Time

Adverbs of time are important in any language as they help us to indicate when an action takes place. In Spanish, there are several adverbs of time that are commonly used. Here are some of the most common ones:

## Ya

"Ya" is used to indicate that an action has already taken place. For example:

- Ya he comido. (I have already eaten.)
- Ya he visto esa película. (I have already seen that movie.)

## Aún / todavía

"Aún" and "todavía" are both used to indicate that an action has not yet taken place. They are often used interchangeably, although "todavía" is slightly more formal. For example:

- Aún no he comido. / Todavía no he comido. (I haven't eaten yet.)
- Aún no hemos visto esa película. / Todavía no hemos visto esa película. (We haven't seen that movie yet.)

## Antes / antes de

"Antes" and "antes de" both mean "before" and are used to indicate that something happens before something else. However, "antes" can be used on its own, while "antes de" is usually followed by a noun or an infinitive. For example:

- Antes de la cena, voy a dar un paseo. (Before dinner, I'm going for a walk.)
- Necesito hacer mi trabajo antes. (I need to do my work before.)

## Después / después de

"Después" and "después de" both mean "after" and are used to indicate that something happens after something else. However, "después" can be used on its own, while "después de" is usually followed by a noun or an infinitive. For example:

- Después de la cena, voy a ver una película. (After dinner, I'm going to watch a movie.)
- Necesito hacer mi trabajo después. (I need to do my work after.)

## Siempre

"Siempre" means "always" and is used to indicate that something happens on a regular basis. For example:

- Siempre me levanto temprano. (I always get up early.)
- Siempre comemos juntos los domingos. (We always eat together on Sundays.)

## Nunca / jamás

"Nunca" and "jamás" both mean "never" and are used to indicate that something has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the future. "Jamás" is a stronger form of "nunca". For example:

- Nunca he nadado en el mar. (I have never swum in the sea.)
- Jamás volveré a confiar en él. (I will never trust him again.)

In conclusion, the use of adverbs of time in Spanish is essential to correctly convey the timing of an action or event. By mastering these adverbs, you'll be able to express yourself more accurately and clearly in Spanish conversations.
