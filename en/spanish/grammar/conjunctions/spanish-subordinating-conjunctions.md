# Spanish Subordinating Conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions are an integral part of many languages, including Spanish. These conjunctions play a vital role in connecting clauses within a sentence and help to convey the relationship between two ideas or concepts. In Spanish, there are many subordinating conjunctions that are essential to know and understand to construct effective sentences. 

## What are Spanish Subordinating Conjunctions?

A subordinating conjunction is a word that connects two clauses, making one of them dependent on the other. In general, subordinating conjunctions introduce subordinate clauses, which provide further details or explanation on the main clause. In Spanish, subordinating conjunctions can be used in various situations, such as expressing cause and effect, time, comparison, purpose, and condition. 

Some of the most common Spanish subordinating conjunctions include:

- **que**: This conjunction is a versatile one and can be used to indicate a variety of relationships between clauses. It is commonly used for introducing statements of fact or opinion, as well as expressing cause or effect. It can also be used to introduce indirect discourse or to express doubt or uncertainty.

- **si**: This conjunction is primarily used to introduce conditional clauses, expressing hypothetical or doubtful situations. It is also used to introduce indirect questions.

- **cuando**: This conjunction is used to indicate a specific point in time, expressing when an action or event occurs.

- **como**: This conjunction is used to express the way in which an action is performed, and also to compare two things, expressing similarity.

- **porque**: This conjunction is used to introduce a clause that expresses the reason or cause for an action or event.

- **aunque**: This conjunction is used to express a concession, indicating that the subordinate clause contradicts the main clause.

- **mientras**: This conjunction is used to express a progressive action occurring simultaneously with another action.

- **después (de) que**: This conjunction is used to indicate that an action or event happens after another action or event.

## How to Use Spanish Subordinating Conjunctions?

Using subordinating conjunctions in Spanish can be tricky, especially for non-native speakers. One of the most important things to remember when using Spanish subordinating conjunctions is to pay attention to the verb tenses. In Spanish, different verb tenses are used to express various relationships between clauses.

For example, if you are using the conjunction **que** to express an action that occurs simultaneously with another action, you need to use the present tense in the subordinate clause. On the other hand, if you are using **que** to express an action that happened before another action, you need to use the preterite or imperfect tense in the subordinate clause.

Another essential thing to remember is that the word order in Spanish tends to be flexible, and the subordinate clause can come before or after the main clause, depending on the context.

## Examples of Spanish Subordinating Conjunctions.

To better understand how to use Spanish subordinating conjunctions, it's always helpful to look at examples.

- **Que**: Quiero que me llames mañana. (I want you to call me tomorrow.)
- **Si**: Si tuviera más tiempo, iría al cine. (If I had more time, I would go to the cinema.)

- **Porque**: No voy al cine porque no tengo dinero. (I'm not going to the cinema because I don't have any money.)
