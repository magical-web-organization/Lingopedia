# Spanish Future Progressive Tense

The Spanish language has several tenses that express future events, but none is as specific as the future progressive tense. In this article, we will be discussing the Spanish future progressive tense and how it is used.

## What is the Spanish Future Progressive Tense?

The Spanish Future Progressive Tense, also known as the future continuous, is a verb tense that expresses ongoing action that will take place in the future. This tense is formed by combining the future indicative of the verb "estar" and the present participle of the main verb.

### Formation

The formula to form the Spanish Future Progressive Tense is as follows:

`Estar (future indicative) + Present Participle of the main verb`

For example, let's take the verb "comer," meaning "to eat."

| Pronoun | Future Indicative of Estar | Present Participle | Future Progressive Tense |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Yo      | estaré                    | comiendo          | estaré comiendo          |
| Tú      | estarás                   | comiendo          | estarás comiendo         |
| Él/Ella/Usted | estará                | comiendo          | estará comiendo          |
| Nosotros/Nosotras | estaremos          | comiendo          | estaremos comiendo       |
| Vosotros/Vosotras | estaréis           | comiendo          | estaréis comiendo        |
| Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes | estarán          | comiendo          | estarán comiendo         |

### Examples

- Yo estaré comiendo una hamburguesa a las tres de la tarde. (I will be eating a hamburger at three o'clock in the afternoon.)
- Ellos estarán estudiando para el examen final toda la noche. (They will be studying for the final exam all night long.)
- Tú estarás trabajando en la oficina todo el día mañana. (You will be working in the office all day tomorrow.)

## Uses of The Spanish Future Progressive Tense

The Spanish Future Progressive Tense expresses an action that will be ongoing at some point in the future. This tense is primarily used for actions that will be in progress and still in progress at a specified time in the near future.

It is also used to describe future actions that will be interrupted by another action. In this case, the action in progress is described in the Spanish Future Progressive Tense, and the interrupting action is described either in the Simple Future or Present Simple tense.

### Examples

- Estaré limpiando mi habitación cuando llegues. (I will be cleaning my room when you arrive.)
- Ellos estarán jugando en el parque cuando empiece a llover. (They will be playing at the park when it starts to rain.)
- Tú estarás comiendo cuando yo regrese. (You will be eating when I come back.)

In general, the Spanish Future Progressive Tense is used to describe an action that will be happening in the future while stressing on its continuous or progressive nature.
