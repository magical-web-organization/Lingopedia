# A Guide to Understanding Spanish Imperfect Tense

As you learn Spanish, one of the tenses that you will come across is the imperfect tense. It is one of the most common tenses in the language and is used to describe continuous, repeated, or unfinished actions in the past. In this article, we will look at the usage, formation, and some examples of the Spanish imperfect tense.

## Usage of Spanish Imperfect Tense

The imperfect tense is used to describe past events that are ongoing, repeated, or habitual. It is also used to describe physical and emotional states in the past, as well as to give background information about a past event. Some common uses of the imperfect tense include:
