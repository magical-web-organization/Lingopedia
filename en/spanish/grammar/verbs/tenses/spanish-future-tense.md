# Spanish Future Tense: What Is It and How to Use It?

The future tense in Spanish, as in most languages, is used to talk about actions that will happen in the future. In this article, we will dive deep into the ins and outs of the Spanish future tense and how to use it properly in your conversations.

## Formation of the Spanish Future Tense

The formation of the future tense in Spanish is quite simple. To create the future tense, simply add the appropriate endings to the *infinitive* form of the verb, which is the most basic form of the verb. The endings for the future tense are:

-é

-ás

-á

-emos

-éis

-án

For example, let's take the verb *hablar*, which means "to speak". To create the future tense, we take the *infinitive* form of the verb, which is *hablar*, and add the appropriate endings:

- hablaré
- hablarás
- hablará
- hablaremos
- hablaréis
- hablarán

Now, we have the future tense of the verb *hablar*.
