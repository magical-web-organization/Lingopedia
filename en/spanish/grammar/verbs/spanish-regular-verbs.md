# Spanish Regular Verbs

Spanish is a beautiful and widely spoken language with millions of people speaking it across the globe. One of the most important aspects of learning Spanish is understanding how to conjugate verbs, which is the process of changing the verb form to match its subject. 

In this guide, we will focus on regular verbs in Spanish, which are the easiest to learn and apply in different tenses. So, let's get started with the basics!

## What are Regular Verbs?

Regular verbs in Spanish follow a set pattern or conjugation rules, making it easier to memorize and use them in different tenses. These verbs come in three different endings:

- **-ar** verbs (e.g. hablar - to speak)
- **-er** verbs (e.g. leer - to read)
- **-ir** verbs (e.g. escribir - to write)

The conjugation of regular verbs in Spanish is based on the tense, subject, and ending of the verb, making it one of the most important and fundamental aspects of Spanish grammar.

## How to Conjugate Regular Verbs in Spanish

In Spanish, regular verbs are conjugated by removing the ending (-ar, -er, or -ir) and adding the appropriate ending that matches the tense and subject. Let's take a closer look at how to conjugate regular verbs in some of the most common tenses in Spanish:

### Present Tense

The present tense in Spanish is used to describe actions that are happening right now or are ongoing. To conjugate regular verbs in the present tense, you need to:

- Remove the ending (-ar, -er, or -ir)
- Add the appropriate ending based on the subject

Here are the present tense conjugations for the regular verb hablar (to speak):

| Subject | Conjugation |
| --- | --- |
| Yo | hablo |
| Tú | hablas |
| Él/Ella/Usted | habla |
| Nosotros/Nosotras | hablamos |
| Vosotros/Vosotras | habláis |
| Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes | hablan |

### Preterite Tense

The preterite tense in Spanish is used to describe actions that have been completed in the past. To conjugate regular verbs in the preterite tense, you need to:

- Remove the ending (-ar, -er, or -ir)
- Add the appropriate ending based on the subject

Here are the preterite tense conjugations for the regular verb leer (to read):

| Subject | Conjugation |
| --- | --- |
| Yo | leí |
| Tú | leíste |
| Él/Ella/Usted | leyó |
| Nosotros/Nosotras | leímos |
| Vosotros/Vosotras | leísteis |
| Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes | leyeron |

### Imperfect Tense

The imperfect tense in Spanish is used to describe actions that were ongoing or repeated in the past. To conjugate regular verbs in the imperfect tense, you need to:

- Remove the ending (-ar, -er, or -ir)
- Add the appropriate ending based on the subject

Here are the imperfect tense conjugations for the regular verb escribir (to write):

| Subject | Conjugation |
| --- | --- |
| Yo | escribía |
| Tú | escribías |
| Él/Ella/Usted | escribía |
| Nosotros/Nosotras | escribíamos |
| Vosotros/Vosotras | escribíais |
| Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes | escribían |

### Future Tense

The future tense in Spanish is used to describe actions that will happen in the future. To conjugate regular verbs in the future tense, you need to:

- Add the appropriate ending based on the subject
- Use the infinitive form of the verb, which is the verb with the -ar, -er, or -ir ending, without the ending

Here are the future tense conjugations for the regular verb caminar (to walk):

| Subject | Conjugation |
| --- | --- |
| Yo | caminaré |
| Tú | caminarás |
| Él/Ella/Usted | caminará |
| Nosotros/Nosotras | caminaremos |
| Vosotros/Vosotras | caminaréis |
| Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes | caminarán |
