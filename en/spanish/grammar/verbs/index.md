Spanish is a widely spoken language, and it is the official language of 20 countries. Verbs are the backbone of any language, including Spanish. In this article, we will discuss Spanish verbs and their conjugations.

## Regular verbs

In Spanish, regular verbs follow the same pattern, and they conjugate in predictable ways based on the endings of the infinitive verb. Most regular verbs end with "ar," "er," or "ir." Let's take an example of the verb "hablar," which means "to speak."

| Person | Present Tense |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Yo     | hablo         |
| Tú     | hablas        |
| Él/Ella/Usted | habla   |
| Nosotros(as) | hablamos |
| Vosotros(as) | habláis   |
| Ellos(as)/Ustedes | hablan |

As you can see, the stem of the verb (habl-) remains the same for every conjugation, and the endings (-o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an) change according to the subject of the verb.

## Irregular verbs

Irregular verbs do not follow the same pattern as regular verbs. They have distinct conjugations in the present tense, and they need to be memorized. Here are a few examples of irregular verbs:

### Tener (to have)

| Person | Present Tense |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Yo     | tengo         |
| Tú     | tienes        |
| Él/Ella/Usted | tiene   |
| Nosotros(as) | tenemos |
| Vosotros(as) | tenéis   |
| Ellos(as)/Ustedes | tienen |

### Ser (to be)

| Person | Present Tense |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Yo     | soy           |
| Tú     | eres          |
| Él/Ella/Usted | es      |
| Nosotros(as) | somos   |
| Vosotros(as) | sois     |
| Ellos(as)/Ustedes | son |

### Estar (to be)

| Person | Present Tense |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Yo     | estoy         |
| Tú     | estás         |
| Él/Ella/Usted | está  |
| Nosotros(as) | estamos |
| Vosotros(as) | estáis   |
| Ellos(as)/Ustedes | están |

## Stem-changing verbs

Stem-changing verbs, also known as "boot verbs," are the verbs that change their stems in the present tense. The changes occur in the vowel of the stem. Let’s take an example of the verb "pensar," which means "to think."

| Person | Present Tense |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Yo     | pienso        |
| Tú     | piensas       |
| Él/Ella/Usted | piensa |
| Nosotros(as) | pensamos |
| Vosotros(as) | pensáis   |
| Ellos(as)/Ustedes | piensan |

As you can see, the stem vowel "e' changes to "ie" for all but the first person singular present tense.

## Conclusion

Learning Spanish verbs can seem daunting at first, but understanding the patterns and rules can make it much simpler. In summary, regular verbs have predictable conjugations, irregular verbs need to be memorized, and stem-changing verbs have a predictable pattern. Practice makes perfect, so practice conjugating Spanish verbs as much as you can, and soon, you'll be speaking Spanish fluently. Adiós!
