# Spanish Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns, avoiding their repetition and making our speech more fluent. In Spanish, there are different types of pronouns, each one with a specific use. In this article, we will learn about Spanish pronouns and how to use them correctly in conversations and writing.

## Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns are used to indicate the person performing the action in a sentence. In Spanish, the subject pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Yo (I) | Nosotros/Nosotras (We) |
| Tú (You) | Vosotros/Vosotras (You-all) |
| Él (He) | Ellos (They, masculine) |
| Ella (She) | Ellas (They, feminine) |
| Usted (You) | Ustedes (You-all formal) |

Note that in Spain, instead of "ustedes," "vosotros" is commonly used as the plural "you-all" informal form.

### Verb Conjugation with Subject Pronouns

In Spanish, the verb conjugation changes depending on the subject pronoun. For example:

- Yo hablo español. (I speak Spanish.)
- Tú hablas español. (You speak Spanish.)
- Él/Ella habla español. (He/She speaks Spanish.)
- Nosotros/Nosotras hablamos español. (We speak Spanish.)
- Vosotros/Vosotras habláis español. (You-all speak Spanish.)
- Ellos/Ellas hablan español. (They speak Spanish.)
- Ustedes hablan español. (You-all speak Spanish.)

## Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

Direct and indirect object pronouns are used to replace direct and indirect objects in a sentence.

### Direct Object Pronouns

Direct object pronouns replace the noun that is the direct recipient of the action in the sentence. In Spanish, the direct object pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Me (Me) | Nos (Us) |
| Te (You) | Os (You-all) |
| Lo/La (Him/Her/It) | Los/Las (Them) |

For example:

- Juan me compró un regalo. (Juan bought me a gift.)
- Tú compraste el libro. Lo leí ayer. (You bought the book. I read it yesterday.)

### Indirect Object Pronouns

Indirect object pronouns replace the noun that is the indirect recipient of the action in the sentence. In Spanish, the indirect object pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Me (To me) | Nos (To us) |
| Te (To you) | Os (To you-all) |
| Le (To him/her/you) | Les (To them/you-all) |

For example:

- Juan le dio el libro a María. (Juan gave the book to María.)
- Yo te escribí una carta. (I wrote you a letter.)

### Placement of Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

In Spanish, direct and indirect object pronouns are placed in front of the verb. The order is indirect object pronoun + direct object pronoun. If both pronouns begin with the letter "l" (lo/la/los/las), the indirect object pronoun changes to "se." For example:

- Juan me lo dio. (Juan gave it to me.)
- Él no se las compró. (He didn't buy them for her.)

## Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns indicate that the subject is also the object of the verb. In Spanish, reflexive pronouns are formed by adding "se" at the end of the verb. The reflexive pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Me (Myself) | Nos (Ourselves) |
| Te (Yourself) | Os (Yourself-all) |
| Se (Himself/herself/itself/yourself) | Se (Themselves/yourself-all) |

For example:

- Yo me lavo los dientes. (I brush my teeth.)
- Ella se arregló el pelo antes de salir. (She fixed her hair before going out.)

## Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns indicate ownership or possession of something. In Spanish, the possessive pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Mío/Mía (Mine) | Nuestro/Nuestra (Ours) |
| Tuyo/Tuya (Yours) | Vuestro/Vuestra (Yours-all) |
| Suyo/Suya (His/hers/its/yours) | Suyo/Suya (Theirs/yours-all) |

For example:

- Este libro es mío. (This book is mine.)
- ¿Son estos tus zapatos? No, los míos son negros. (Are these your shoes? No, mine are black.)

## Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns indicate a specific thing or person. In Spanish, the demonstrative pronouns are:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| Este/Esta (This) | Estos/Estas (These) |
| Ese/Esa (That) | Esos/Esas (Those) |
| Aquel/Aquella (That over there) | Aquellos/Aquellas (Those over there) |

For example:

- Esa es mi bicicleta. (That's my bicycle.)
- Aquellas montañas son muy altas. (Those mountains over there are very high.)

## Interrogative Pronouns

Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions about people, things or actions. In Spanish, the interrogative pronouns are:

| Pronoun | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| ¿Quién? (Who?) | Refers to people. |
| ¿Qué? (What?) | Refers to things. |
| ¿Cuál? (Which?) | Used when there are multiple options. |
| ¿Dónde? (Where?) | Asks about location. |
| ¿Cuándo? (When?) | Asks about time. |
| ¿Por qué? (Why?) | Asks about the reason. |
| ¿Cómo? (How?) | Asks about the way something is done. |

For example:

- ¿Quién es tu amigo? (Who is your friend?)
- ¿Dónde está el baño? (Where is the bathroom?)
- ¿Por qué no fuiste a la fiesta? (Why didn't you go to the party?)
